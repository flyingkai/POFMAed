1. The Facebook post by Mr Brad Bowyer contains false statements of fact and misleading statements.

Falsehoods

I.  Singapore Government’s involvement in investment decisions by Temasek and GIC

2. Mr Bowyer implies that the Singapore Government controls Temasek’s and GIC’s commercial decisions. This is false.

3. The Government does not influence, let alone direct, the individual investment decisions made by Temasek and GIC. Which companies they invest in, or divest from, is entirely the responsibility of their respective management teams. The Government likewise does not interfere in the commercial decisions of Temasek’s and GIC’s portfolio companies.

4. Temasek and GIC are run on market principles, independent of the Government. Many of their portfolio companies are publicly listed. The Government’s role is to ensure that Temasek and GIC have competent boards, which ensure that their respective mandates are met. The Government also holds the boards of Temasek and GIC accountable for their respective overall performances.

II.  Amaravati Project

5. Mr Bowyer says “…we also saw the recent canning of the Amaravati city project part of the S$4 billion already dumped into Andhra Pradesh by GLCs and related parties so India has not been so good an investment choice after all…”. There are implicit factual assertions that (1) a substantial part of S$4 billion invested in Andhra Pradesh was put into the Amaravati project; and (2) S$4 billion has been poorly invested (“dumped”) by Government-linked companies (“GLCs”) and related parties in Andhra Pradesh. These are false.

6. First, the Singapore Consortium (comprising Ascendas Singbridge Pte Ltd (now part of CapitaLand Group) and Sembcorp Development Ltd) in the Amaravati project has stated publicly that the costs incurred have been limited to design services prior to commencement of execution works on the ground, amounting to a few million dollars. There are no billions of dollars involved.
 
7. Second, not only GLCs and related parties have invested in Andhra Pradesh. Several other Singaporean companies have also done so. An example of a non-GLC investment in Andhra Pradesh is Indus Coffee Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of a listed company in Singapore.  

III.  Salt Bae

8. Mr Bowyer asserts that Temasek invested in the debt-ridden parent company which owns Salt Bae. This is false.

9. The Salt Bae chain of restaurants is owned by a company called D.ream International BV, which operates 60 restaurants throughout the world via four operating subsidiaries. Temasek invested in D.ream International BV, and not in one of D.ream International BV’s shareholders called Doğuş Holding A.Ş. The company that is reportedly in difficulties according to the article cited by Mr Bowyer, is Doğuş Holding A.Ş., and not D.ream International BV.";"Additional Clarifications

10. Additional clarifications on the points Mr Bowyer has raised are set out below.

Temasek, GIC and public funds 

11. Mr Bowyer uses false and misleading statements to smear the reputation of Temasek and GIC:

a. Over the past 20 years, Temasek’s total shareholder return has been 7% (annualised, in SGD terms). Temasek’s overall portfolio has grown from less than S$100 billion in 2002 to over S$300 billion today.

b. Temasek is subject to market scrutiny and discipline. Since 2004, Temasek has published its financial information annually. Temasek also issues Bonds and Eurocommercial Paper to retail, institutional, accredited and other specified investors as part of its financial discipline. Additionally, Temasek has been rated Aaa by Moody’s Investors Service and AAA by S&P Global Ratings, ever since its inaugural ratings in 2004. 

c. Under the Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework, the expected returns of Temasek, GIC and MAS together, contribute around 20% of Government revenue currently. The Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) is the single largest contributor to Government revenue, exceeding GST.

d. This contrasts starkly with most other countries. In the United States, 1 out of every 10 dollars of US federal government revenue goes towards servicing interest payments on the federal debt. In Singapore, 1 out of every 5 dollars of revenue spent comes from the returns on our reserves. In other words, instead of having to tax citizens to service interest on government debt, Singapore has managed to increase social and other spending through NIRC from Temasek, GIC and MAS, while keeping taxes low.

e. Temasek and GIC are managed prudently and competently. No other sovereign wealth funds have contributed so significantly to national budgets and the economy, without relying on natural resources or a large domestic economy.

Keppel

12. Mr Bowyer suggests Keppel Corporation or its subsidiary has suffered losses due to the $0.5 billion fine imposed. This is misleading.

13. In the last 33 years, Keppel has made profits every year. In the last 4 years, Keppel has made profits of S$3.4 billion, including a S$196 million net profit in the year when the Brazilian fine was imposed. Keppel has been declaring dividends regularly as a listed company to all its shareholders, including Temasek.

Bharti Airtel

14. Mr Bowyer refers to Singtel’s investment in Bharti Airtel. Singtel’s shareholding today is valued at S$13 billion, which is more than double its investment to date of S$5.1 billion. Bharti Airtel faces a number of recent regulatory and Indian Supreme Court decisions. These are matters for Bharti Airtel and Singtel to address.

Amaravati Project

15. Mr Bowyer suggests that S$4 billion in investments by GLCs and related parties in Andhra Pradesh have all been doing poorly. Mr Bowyer makes this sweeping statement, but gives no basis for it.";Primary;;No;NA;Unknown;Unable to find the described Facebook post.;05 May 2020;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1. The Facebook post by the States Times Review (""STR""), published on 23 Nov 2019, contains false statements of fact.

Falsehoods

2. The STR refers to a Facebook post by ""NUSSU – NUS Students United"" (""NSU"") which had misleadingly quoted Minister K Shanmugam as saying that a political candidate running for elections must resign from all executive positions that they hold in organisations with religious leanings.

3. The STR falsely asserts that:

Fact #1:  the number of local PMETs employed has increased from 1.17 million in 2015 to 1.30 million in 2019. 

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s Comprehensive Labour Force Survey (CLFS) shows local PMETs employment has risen steadily since 2015. In fact, as a proportion of the total local workforce, the local PMET share has increased from 54% in 2015 to 58% in 2019.

The number of Employment Pass (EP) holders has historically fluctuated depending on economic conditions.  EP qualifying salaries are also regularly adjusted to safeguard employment of local PMETs.  As a result, local PMET employment has continued to grow while the number of EP holders in Singapore  remained stable, ranging from 187,900 in 2015 to 185,800 in 2018. The latest figure as of Jun 2019 is 189,000.

SDP’s statements seek to mislead Singaporeans

The Singapore economy is continuing to create jobs despite the economic headwinds. Local PMET employment has increased consistently. There is no rising trend of retrenchment, whether amongst PMETs or otherwise.

Given the current uncertain economic climate, it is understandable that some Singaporeans feel anxious about employment prospects and retrenchments. This makes it all the more critical that public debate on the important issue of jobs is based on accurate facts, and not distortions or falsehoods.

These false and misleading statements by the SDP have a singular objective – to stoke fear and anxiety among local PMETs. It is important to set the facts straight so that Singaporeans are not misled.

The Facebook posts by Mr Lim Tean contain false and misleading statements.
 
Falsehood

2. Mr Lim states that “the total pot available to Singaporean students [is] $167 million compared to the $238 million that is spent on foreign students”. He further states that “PAP spends $167 million on Grants & Bursaries for Singaporeans, but $238 million on foreign students??”. These statements imply that MOE spends less on Singaporean students than on foreign students.
 
3. This is false and misleading.
 
4. MOE’s annual budget is $13B, almost all of which is spent on Singapore citizens. The $167M cited by Mr Lim refers only to bursaries for Singaporean tertiary students, and grossly understates MOE’s total spending on Singaporean citizens for education. 

5. The figures of $167M and $238M are therefore not comparable.

6.  The more appropriate comparison should be nearly $13B spent on Singaporean students to provide subsidised education for all Singaporean students at all levels, as against the $238M attributed to foreign students referred to by Mr Lim Tean, which is less than 2% of the total education budget.

7. Further, it should be noted that much of MOE’s budget goes towards costs such as infrastructure, facilities, laboratories, faculty and teaching force, etc., which are either fixed or non-variable up to the medium term, to provide education for Singaporean students. A large part of the $238M attributed to foreign students comprises these fixed and non-variable costs that we have to incur anyway, whether or not we admit a small proportion of foreign students (currently 5%) in the system.

8. This was explained by the Minister for Education in Parliament on 5 August 2019. [https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/government-spending-on-foreign-students]";"Additional Clarifications

9. Our admissions system ensures that no Singaporean student is deprived of a place by a foreign student. Having a small proportion of foreign students in our schools and institutions brings diversity into classrooms and helps our students develop cross-cultural competencies, a key skill in today’s world.

10.  Likewise, many Singaporean students receive scholarships from, and study in, other countries. We are all part of an inter-connected global ecosystem.

The Facebook posts by Mr Lim Tean contain false and misleading statements.
 
Falsehood

2. Mr Lim states that “the total pot available to Singaporean students [is] $167 million compared to the $238 million that is spent on foreign students”. He further states that “PAP spends $167 million on Grants & Bursaries for Singaporeans, but $238 million on foreign students??”. These statements imply that MOE spends less on Singaporean students than on foreign students.
 
3. This is false and misleading.
 
4. MOE’s annual budget is $13B, almost all of which is spent on Singapore citizens. The $167M cited by Mr Lim refers only to bursaries for Singaporean tertiary students, and grossly understates MOE’s total spending on Singaporean citizens for education. 

5. The figures of $167M and $238M are therefore not comparable.

6.  The more appropriate comparison should be nearly $13B spent on Singaporean students to provide subsidised education for all Singaporean students at all levels, as against the $238M attributed to foreign students referred to by Mr Lim Tean, which is less than 2% of the total education budget.

7. Further, it should be noted that much of MOE’s budget goes towards costs such as infrastructure, facilities, laboratories, faculty and teaching force, etc., which are either fixed or non-variable up to the medium term, to provide education for Singaporean students. A large part of the $238M attributed to foreign students comprises these fixed and non-variable costs that we have to incur anyway, whether or not we admit a small proportion of foreign students (currently 5%) in the system.

8. This was explained by the Minister for Education in Parliament on 5 August 2019. [https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/government-spending-on-foreign-students]";"Additional Clarifications

9. Our admissions system ensures that no Singaporean student is deprived of a place by a foreign student. Having a small proportion of foreign students in our schools and institutions brings diversity into classrooms and helps our students develop cross-cultural competencies, a key skill in today’s world.

10.  Likewise, many Singaporean students receive scholarships from, and study in, other countries. We are all part of an inter-connected global ecosystem.

Falsehoods

LFL's allegation that the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) applies the alleged procedure for judicial executions is completely baseless

2. In their statement, LFL falsely asserted that:

“prison officers were instructed to carry out the following brutal procedure whenever the rope breaks during a hanging, which happens from time to time.

a) The prison officer is instructed to pull the rope around the neck of the prisoner towards him.
b) Meanwhile, another prison officer will apply pressure by pulling the body in the opposite direction.
c) The first officer must then kick the back of the neck of the prisoner with great force in order to break it.
d) The officers are told to kick the back of the neck because that would be consistent with death by hanging.
e) The officers are told not to kick more than 2 times, so that there will be no tell-tale marks in case there is an autopsy.
f) Strict orders are also given not to divulge the above to other prison staff not involved in executions.”

3. SPS does not apply the procedure as alleged by LFL for judicial executions. No effort is spared to ensure that all judicial executions in Singapore are carried out in strict compliance with the law. All judicial executions are conducted in the presence of the Superintendent of the Prison and a medical doctor, among others. The law also requires a Coroner (who is a Judicial Officer of the State Courts) to conduct an inquiry within 24 hours of the execution to satisfy himself that the execution was carried out duly and properly. For the record, the rope used for judicial executions has never broken before. This fact alone shows the falsity of LFL's allegations.";"Additional Clarifications

4. LFL also made spurious allegations that prison officers were “given special training to carry out the brutal execution method”, that the Singapore Government approved of these ""unlawful methods"", and suggested that specific measures were adopted to cover up these methods. These allegations are entirely unfounded.

5. Prison officers certainly do not receive any “special training to carry out the brutal execution method” as alleged. Any acts such as those described in the LFL statement would have been thoroughly investigated and dealt with.

6. These scurrilous allegations of misconduct follow a series of sensational and untrue stories previously published by LFL. LFL has been publishing various falsehoods to seek attention in hopes of getting Malaysian prisoners, who have been convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death in Singapore, off the death penalty.

At 10.10am on 30 January 2020, The States Times Review said on its Facebook page that Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Transport, Dr Lam Pin Min confirmed that Singapore had run out of face masks, and insinuated that Dr Lam Pin Min was blaming Singaporeans for “insensible and irresponsible” use of surgical masks. Mr Tan also posted that Singapore had run out of masks since last Sunday, less than three days after the first confirmed case.
 
In his Facebook post on 28 January 2020, Dr Lam Pin Min was clearly pictured in a warehouse which showed part of the Government stockpile of surgical masks. His Facebook post also stated clearly that there is sufficient supply of masks if people use them sensibly and responsibly. ";"Additional clarifications
 
On 30 January 2020, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said in a press conference that the Singapore Armed Forces would begin packing more than 5.2 million surgical masks this afternoon. The masks would be distributed to local resident households in packets of four surgical masks per household from this Saturday. This clearly indicates that Singapore has not run out of face masks for Singaporeans. During the same press conference, both Minister Lawrence Wong and Mr Chan informed the media that the Government had distributed more than 5 million surgical masks from the stockpile to retailers over the last nine days, which had all been snapped up immediately. 

Although the stockpile is currently sufficient to meet the needs of our public healthcare institutions, we must continue to manage the private usage rate and prioritise the allocation of surgical masks to those who need it the most. This includes our healthcare workers on the frontline and the vulnerable within our society.  The Ministry of Trade and Industry is actively working on identifying new suppliers of surgical masks and will continue to ensure that existing lines of supplies are kept robust.

Falsehoods

On 13 February 2020, STR published a Facebook post on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore claiming that:

The Government is unable to trace the source of infection for any of the infected COVID-19 cases in Singapore;
The Government is ""the only one"" telling the public not to wear a mask;
Each ""China worker"" will also get S$100 a day for 14 days of Leave of Absence, fully paid for by the Singapore government;
Minister for Manpower, Mrs Josephine Teo, said that she was working hard to bring more workers from China into Singapore; and
Seven countries have since banned travel to Singapore, citing lack of confidence in the Singapore government’s public health measures
The above are entirely false, for the following reasons:

First, as of 12:00 pm on 13 Feb 2020, the Ministry of Health (""MOH"") has established through epidemiological investigation and contact tracing that 51 out of the 58 cases have either had travel history to mainland China, or links with previously announced cases. Contact tracing is underway for the remaining seven locally-transmitted cases in an attempt to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China.
 
Second, MOH's advice that there is no need for individuals who are well to wear a mask is in-line with the World Health Organisation's guidance on the use of masks in the community in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. Health authorities in other countries such as the US and Australia have also expressly advised that they do not recommend that masks be worn by people who are well. As a good hygiene practice, people who are unwell and who have respiratory symptoms should wear a mask so that they minimise the risk of them infecting  others.

Third, Chinese Work Pass holders placed on a mandatory 14-day Leave of Absence (""LOA"") do not receive the $100 daily support. Instead, it is their employer who would receive the support. Under the Leave of Absence Support Programme (""LOASP""), eligible employers can apply for $100 daily per affected worker for the required duration of paid LOA granted to the worker. The LOASP also covers all workers, regardless of nationality. This includes Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Work Pass holders who have travelled to mainland China on or before 31 January 2020, and who were placed on LOA upon their return to Singapore on or after 31 January 2020.

Fourth, at no time did the Minister for Manpower Mrs Josephine Teo say she was working hard to bring more Chinese workers back to Singapore. In fact, the Ministry of Manpower (""MOM"") requires employers of work pass holders with travel history to mainland China to obtain prior approval so as to slow down their workers’ return to Singapore. MOM approved about 200 applications daily for planned arrivals between 9 and 12 Feb 2020, giving priority to applications in essential services like healthcare, transport and waste management so that operations in these sectors are not compromised. Many more applications were rejected.

Fifth, as of 8:00 pm on 13 Feb 2020, no countries have banned travel to Singapore.";"Additional Clarifications

All work pass holders with travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days and who are planning to enter/return to Singapore after 2359 hrs on 8 February 2020, will be required to obtain MOM's prior approval before they commence their journey. This is regardless of the nationality of the work pass holder.

Upon arrival in Singapore, all work pass holders with travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days will be placed on mandatory 14-day LOA. Employers will have to arrange for suitable premises to house these returning employees for the duration of their LOA.

In addition, the Singapore Government is working in close cooperation with our foreign counterparts. We have been actively sharing information with our foreign counterparts on Singapore's measures to manage COVID-2019. The international community, businesses and visitors, can be confident in Singapore's commitment to share information openly and swiftly, to protect public health and maintain safety and stability. Singapore has been cited as a positive model in respect of our transparency and response to the COVID-2019 outbreak. In particular, the World Health Organization highlighted the strength of Singapore's response, noting that even before the first case in Singapore was detected, preparedness activities were already underway to rapidly detect and respond to the virus.

default, and that they have been staying at her sister’s house.
3 On 21 February 2020, TISG published an article and Facebook post on ‘Lina’
reiterating the same claims, after it approached Goh to obtain more details.
4 The claims listed in both articles are entirely false, for the following reasons:
 First, HDB did not evict ‘Lina’ from her rental flat. ‘Lina’ was previously
living in a HDB rental flat with her husband and children. The family did
not have any overdue rent throughout the period of the last tenancy.
‘Lina’’s husband terminated the tenancy for the rental flat and returned
the keys to HDB in early February 2020.

subsidies and food rations, from various government agencies and community
partners – the Ministry of Social Development (MSF), the Ministry of Education (MOE),
the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), HDB and the Sembawang Family
Service Centre. The family also received food rations and supermarket vouchers from
their local grassroots organisation.
7 HDB public rental flats cater to needy Singaporean households who have no
other housing options and no family support. HDB works closely with other agencies
and community partners, such as Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres,
to provide support to rental tenants.

reiterating the same claims, after it approached Goh to obtain more details.
4 The claims listed in both articles are entirely false, for the following reasons:
 First, HDB did not evict ‘Lina’ from her rental flat. ‘Lina’ was previously
living in a HDB rental flat with her husband and children. The family did
not have any overdue rent throughout the period of the last tenancy.
‘Lina’’s husband terminated the tenancy for the rental flat and returned
the keys to HDB in early February 2020.
 Second, ‘Lina’ and her husband have bought a new flat from HDB, which
has been paid for in full. ‘Lina’ and her family have since moved into their
new HDB flat. ";"(From POFMA Office Press Release) Additional Clarifications
5 When HDB staff visited ‘Lina’ and her husband in their new flat on 22 February
2020, the couple explained that it was a relative who had approached Goh for
assistance.
6 ‘Lina’ and her family have been receiving assistance, including cash, vouchers,
subsidies and food rations, from various government agencies and community
partners – the Ministry of Social Development (MSF), the Ministry of Education (MOE),
the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), HDB and the Sembawang Family
Service Centre. The family also received food rations and supermarket vouchers from
their local grassroots organisation.
7 HDB public rental flats cater to needy Singaporean households who have no
other housing options and no family support. HDB works closely with other agencies
and community partners, such as Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres,
to provide support to rental tenants.
8 The false statements reported by Goh and TISG give the impression that HDB
has deprived a needy family of public rental housing because of their inability to pay
for it. This is not the case and it is important to set the facts straight.

Falsehoods

	I. Source of funding for Singapore Airlines' S$15 billion capital raising exercise

In the Facebook post, the author stated, ""Don't be too happy that you have $48b. The bulk of almost 1/3 goes to SIA, 55% TEMASEK OWNED (how did our national carrier became temasek own at 55%???). Cash n immediate release to SIA!” The author has claimed that almost one third of the support provided under the Resilience Budget will be provided to Singapore Airlines (""SIA""). This is false. 

SIA's S$15 billion capital raising exercise, announced on 26 March 2020, is distinct and separate from the Resilience Budget, and is not funded by the Government.

	II. Use of S$17 billion from Past Reserves

The author also stated in the Facebook Post, ""...president halimah open reserves of $17b is mainly for Temasek.” In this statement, the author has claimed that the S$17 billion from Singapore’s Past Reserves will be used mainly for Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (""Temasek""). This is also false.

To support the Resilience Budget, the Government is proposing to draw up to S$17 billion from our Past Reserves for broad-based economy-wide and sector-wide schemes. The schemes drawing on Past Reserves are:

	Economy-wide Support Measures

Enhancement of Jobs Support Scheme (S$13.8b)
Enhancement of financing schemes (S$1.7b)
Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (S$1.2b)
	Sector-wide Support Measure
Aviation Support Package (S$0.4b)
None of the above schemes are ring-fenced to be for Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (“Temasek”) or Temasek-linked companies.";"Additional Clarifications

The Government has set aside a total of S$48.4 billion in the Resilience Budget to (i) save jobs, support workers, and protect livelihoods, (ii) help enterprises overcome immediate challenges, and (iii) strengthen economic and social resilience so that we can emerge intact and stronger.

In particular, S$20.0 billion has been set aside in the form of loan capital, to support good companies with strong capabilities and to catalyse private sector loan capital. None of this S$20 billion set aside as loan capital will be used by the Government to subscribe to SIA’s fund-raising exercise announced on 26 March 2020.

S$13.8 billion will go towards enhancing and extending the Jobs Support Scheme (""JSS""), to provide more impactful and sustained wage support for businesses. The JSS covers all sectors, with severely impacted sectors such as aviation, tourism and Food and Beverages (“F&B”) getting additional support. Eligible individuals and households will also benefit under the new Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, as well as the enhanced Care and Support Package.

This is false. The police officers were in fact rendering assistance to the delivery rider who had approached them for help. The GrabFood delivery rider had thought that items were stolen from his motorcycle and approached the Police officers for help. The Police officer in the photo of TTR’s Facebook post was actually taking a statement from the delivery rider. No summons was issued to the delivery rider, and the event had nothing to do with the circuit breaker measures or illegal parking.

Falsehoods

On 18 April 2020, Singapore States Times published a Facebook post on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore claiming that:

The number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection on 17 April was 1,146, and the total number of confirmed cases was 5,573;
Health Minister Mr Gan Kim Yong ordered the reported numbers to be halved to minimise public panic, by reporting numbers in the afternoon instead of later at night;

The above are false, for the following reasons:

There was no instruction given by the Minister for Health or the Government to halve or under-report the number of cases. For the purpose of updating the number of new cases of COVID-19 per 24-hour period, MOH has always used 12pm as the cut-off time since the onset of COVID-19.
There is no cover-up by the Government or MOH. MOH’s daily press releases publish information on all confirmed cases, including the number of imported cases, and the linked and unlinked cases at that point in time, even as contact tracing and epidemiological investigations are ongoing.

Falsehoods

The Authors made various claims that the annual salary of Temasek CEO Ms Ho Ching is “NT$ 2.1 billion”, “about 100 million SGD” or “S$99 million a year”. 

All of the above claims are false. Please refer to https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/news-and-views/news-room/statements/2020/temasek-compensation-framework.";"Additional Clarifications

The Government does not set the remuneration of staff in Temasek; this is the responsibility of its Board and management. The Government holds the Board responsible for the long-term performance of its investments, net of expenses. 

In the case of Temasek, its Board Committee, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee (“LDCC”), is responsible for the establishment of guidelines and policies on performance measurement and compensation plans. In addition, remuneration of the Executive Directors of Temasek Holdings is approved by LDCC and endorsed by its Board.

Temasek’s remuneration framework balances reward for short-term performance and long-term value creation. This has been disclosed in Temasek’s Review since 2008. Temasek’s compensation is benchmarked to the industry and the compensation framework comprises a base salary, as well as short-term, medium-term and long-term incentives. Part of the bonuses are deferred and subject to clawback should Temasek’s returns be negative.

The Government does not set the remuneration of staff in Temasek; this is the responsibility of its Board and management. The Government holds the Board responsible for the long-term performance of its investments, net of expenses. 

In the case of Temasek, its Board Committee, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee (“LDCC”), is responsible for the establishment of guidelines and policies on performance measurement and compensation plans. In addition, remuneration of the Executive Directors of Temasek Holdings is approved by LDCC and endorsed by its Board.

Temasek’s remuneration framework balances reward for short-term performance and long-term value creation. This has been disclosed in Temasek’s Review since 2008. Temasek’s compensation is benchmarked to the industry and the compensation framework comprises a base salary, as well as short-term, medium-term and long-term incentives. Part of the bonuses are deferred and subject to clawback should Temasek’s returns be negative. Temasek has also publicly stated that Ms Ho Ching’s annual compensation is neither the highest within Temasek, nor is she amongst the top five highest paid executives in Temasek.
