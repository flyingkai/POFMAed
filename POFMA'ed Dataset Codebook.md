# POFMA'ed Dataset Codebook

[TOC]

## Introduction: What is POFMA'ed?

POFMA is the **Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act**. It is also commonly known as Singapore's Fake News legislation. The law came into effect on 2 October 2019.

Overviews of the POFMA legislation can be found here:

POFMA'ed is a dataset which aims to record every instance of the use of this legislation, for reference by academics, media practitioners and the general public. It will be updated continually.

This dataset began as part of a discourse analysis research assignment for my university. I have published it online because I believe it might be of interest to others who, like me, were searching for more information on the legislation's use. As a student, I would greatly appreciate any suggestions for improving this dataset.

This dataset is maintained by [Teo Kai Xiang](https://twitter.com/teo_kai_xiang). If you have any comments, corrections, or suggestions, please direct them to POFMAed@gmail.com

This dataset is available on [POFMAed.com](https://pofmaed.com).

## Version Control

This dataset uses [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/) as its versioning convention. The version scheme is as follows: **YYYY.0M.0D** (Year, Month, Day)

The most recent version and past versions can be found on the dataset's Github Repository.

## Sources and Coding Procedure

> The data for each case has been entered manually, using the following sources. The dates on which these sources were last accessed is recorded in the Source Access Date variable (see below).

The POFMA'ed dataset uses the [POFMA Office Press Releases](https://www.pofmaoffice.gov.sg/media-centre/) and [Gov.sg Factually Articles](https://www.gov.sg/factually) for all data other than actor type and accessibility status. The sources used for each case are specified under the Source variables.

To determine the accessibility status of each electronic communication which has been subject to POFMA legislation, the dataset uses media reports, direct sources (the electronic communication itself) or government press releases.

To determine the actor type for each use of POFMA, the dataset uses the target actor's self-identification, via the electronic communication subject to the POFMA usage or other communications by the target actor.

## Unit of Analysis: Reports, Uses and Communications

> The following units of analysis are used. The dataset distinguishes between Reports, POFMA Uses and Communications.

**Report.** Each Report of POFMA legislation's usage released by the government (via a POFMA Office Press Release) is given a Report number. Note that a Report can describe multiple POFMA uses, affecting different electronic communications.

**POFMA Use.** Each use of POFMA legislation (a direction or order) is given a POFMA Use number. Note that a single POFMA direction or order can apply to multiple communications.

**Communication.** Each distinct electronic communication which has been subject to a use of POFMA legislation is given a Communication number. Note that a single electronic communication can be subject to multiple uses of POFMA legislation.

> **Why the distinctions?**
>
> The distinctions are necessary because of how a single Report can describe multiple uses of the POFMA legislation, each of which could affect multiple distinct Electronic Communications.
>
> For example:
>
> - According to Report 1, a Facebook post is the subject of a Correction Direction, issued to Individual A.
> - According to Report 2, this same Facebook post is also the subject of a Targeted Correction Direction, issued to Facebook.
>
> This dataset would thus track that Facebook post as **one Communication**, subject to **two distinct POFMA uses**, according to **two distinct Reports**.

### Legislation Use Variables

> These variables describe each use of the POFMA legislation.

**Source of Request.** This variable records the Minister which requested the POFMA direction, as indicated by the POFMA Office Press Release.

**Type of Direction.** This variable records the type of POFMA direction issued, as indicated by the POFMA Office Press Release. The following categories are used.

- *Part 3 Direction: Correction Direction.* According to the POFMA Office: A Correction Direction is a Direction issued to a person who has communicated a falsehood (i.e. the recipient) that affects the public interest. It requires the recipient to publish a correction notice, providing access to the correct facts. The Direction does not require the recipient to take down their post or make edits to their content, and does not impose criminal sanctions.
- *Part 3 Direction: Stop Communication Direction.* According to the Singapore Statutes: A Stop Communication Direction is one issued to a person who communicated the subject statement in Singapore, requiring the person to stop communicating in Singapore the subject statement by the specified time.
- *Part 4 Direction: Targeted Correction Direction.* According to the POFMA Office: A Targeted Correction Direction is a Direction issued to an Internet Intermediary (â€œII'), whose service was used to communicate a falsehood that affects the public interest. The Direction requires the II to communicate a correction notice by means of its service to all users in Singapore who access the falsehood through its service. This is so that users who see the falsehood on a platform also see the correction notice on that platform.
- *Part 4 Direction: General Correction Direction.* According to the POFMA Office: A General Correction Direction is a Direction issued to prescribed Internet Intermediaries, prescribed telecom and broadcast licensees, and/or prescribed permit holders of the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act that would require them to communicate, publish, broadcast or transmit a correction notice to their users in Singapore.
- *Part 6 Direction: Account Restriction Direction.* According to the Singapore Statutes, the Account Restriction Direction is a Direction to counteract inauthentic online accounts and coordinated inauthentic behaviour.
- *Access Blocking / Disabling Order.* This category covers all directions or orders which disable access to specific content, such as access blocking orders, disabling directions and disabling orders. According to the Ministry of Communications and Information: The Access Blocking Order requires internet access service providers to disable access for end-users in Singapore to the online location where the falsehood was communicated. Access Blocking Orders apply to situations of non-compliance for other directions.

**Communication Description.** This variable records the electronic communication subject to this use of the POFMA legislation. 

- Each electronic communication receives a unique description with the following scheme: *ACTOR*, *MEDIUM*, *CONTENT*, *ID*. For example: *Actor A Facebook Post 2.*

**Medium of Communicated Content.** This variable records the medium through which the electronic communication subject to this use of the POFMA legislation occurred. So far, the following categories have been used.

- *Facebook*
- *Website*
