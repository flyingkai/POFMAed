1. The Facebook post by Mr Brad Bowyer contains false statements of fact and misleading statements.

Falsehoods

I.  Singapore Government’s involvement in investment decisions by Temasek and GIC

2. Mr Bowyer implies that the Singapore Government controls Temasek’s and GIC’s commercial decisions. This is false.

3. The Government does not influence, let alone direct, the individual investment decisions made by Temasek and GIC. Which companies they invest in, or divest from, is entirely the responsibility of their respective management teams. The Government likewise does not interfere in the commercial decisions of Temasek’s and GIC’s portfolio companies.

4. Temasek and GIC are run on market principles, independent of the Government. Many of their portfolio companies are publicly listed. The Government’s role is to ensure that Temasek and GIC have competent boards, which ensure that their respective mandates are met. The Government also holds the boards of Temasek and GIC accountable for their respective overall performances.

II.  Amaravati Project

5. Mr Bowyer says “…we also saw the recent canning of the Amaravati city project part of the S$4 billion already dumped into Andhra Pradesh by GLCs and related parties so India has not been so good an investment choice after all…”. There are implicit factual assertions that (1) a substantial part of S$4 billion invested in Andhra Pradesh was put into the Amaravati project; and (2) S$4 billion has been poorly invested (“dumped”) by Government-linked companies (“GLCs”) and related parties in Andhra Pradesh. These are false.

6. First, the Singapore Consortium (comprising Ascendas Singbridge Pte Ltd (now part of CapitaLand Group) and Sembcorp Development Ltd) in the Amaravati project has stated publicly that the costs incurred have been limited to design services prior to commencement of execution works on the ground, amounting to a few million dollars. There are no billions of dollars involved.
 
7. Second, not only GLCs and related parties have invested in Andhra Pradesh. Several other Singaporean companies have also done so. An example of a non-GLC investment in Andhra Pradesh is Indus Coffee Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of a listed company in Singapore.  

III.  Salt Bae

8. Mr Bowyer asserts that Temasek invested in the debt-ridden parent company which owns Salt Bae. This is false.

9. The Salt Bae chain of restaurants is owned by a company called D.ream International BV, which operates 60 restaurants throughout the world via four operating subsidiaries. Temasek invested in D.ream International BV, and not in one of D.ream International BV’s shareholders called Doğuş Holding A.Ş. The company that is reportedly in difficulties according to the article cited by Mr Bowyer, is Doğuş Holding A.Ş., and not D.ream International BV.","Additional Clarifications

10. Additional clarifications on the points Mr Bowyer has raised are set out below.

Temasek, GIC and public funds 

11. Mr Bowyer uses false and misleading statements to smear the reputation of Temasek and GIC:

a. Over the past 20 years, Temasek’s total shareholder return has been 7% (annualised, in SGD terms). Temasek’s overall portfolio has grown from less than S$100 billion in 2002 to over S$300 billion today.

b. Temasek is subject to market scrutiny and discipline. Since 2004, Temasek has published its financial information annually. Temasek also issues Bonds and Eurocommercial Paper to retail, institutional, accredited and other specified investors as part of its financial discipline. Additionally, Temasek has been rated Aaa by Moody’s Investors Service and AAA by S&P Global Ratings, ever since its inaugural ratings in 2004. 

c. Under the Net Investment Returns (NIR) framework, the expected returns of Temasek, GIC and MAS together, contribute around 20% of Government revenue currently. The Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) is the single largest contributor to Government revenue, exceeding GST.

d. This contrasts starkly with most other countries. In the United States, 1 out of every 10 dollars of US federal government revenue goes towards servicing interest payments on the federal debt. In Singapore, 1 out of every 5 dollars of revenue spent comes from the returns on our reserves. In other words, instead of having to tax citizens to service interest on government debt, Singapore has managed to increase social and other spending through NIRC from Temasek, GIC and MAS, while keeping taxes low.

e. Temasek and GIC are managed prudently and competently. No other sovereign wealth funds have contributed so significantly to national budgets and the economy, without relying on natural resources or a large domestic economy.

Keppel

12. Mr Bowyer suggests Keppel Corporation or its subsidiary has suffered losses due to the $0.5 billion fine imposed. This is misleading.

13. In the last 33 years, Keppel has made profits every year. In the last 4 years, Keppel has made profits of S$3.4 billion, including a S$196 million net profit in the year when the Brazilian fine was imposed. Keppel has been declaring dividends regularly as a listed company to all its shareholders, including Temasek.

Bharti Airtel

14. Mr Bowyer refers to Singtel’s investment in Bharti Airtel. Singtel’s shareholding today is valued at S$13 billion, which is more than double its investment to date of S$5.1 billion. Bharti Airtel faces a number of recent regulatory and Indian Supreme Court decisions. These are matters for Bharti Airtel and Singtel to address.

Amaravati Project

15. Mr Bowyer suggests that S$4 billion in investments by GLCs and related parties in Andhra Pradesh have all been doing poorly. Mr Bowyer makes this sweeping statement, but gives no basis for it.",Primary,,No,NA,Unknown,Unable to find the described Facebook post.,05 May 2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. The Facebook post by the States Times Review (""STR""), published on 23 Nov 2019, contains false statements of fact.

Falsehoods

2. The STR refers to a Facebook post by ""NUSSU – NUS Students United"" (""NSU"") which had misleadingly quoted Minister K Shanmugam as saying that a political candidate running for elections must resign from all executive positions that they hold in organisations with religious leanings.

Fact #1:  the number of local PMETs employed has increased from 1.17 million in 2015 to 1.30 million in 2019. 

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s Comprehensive Labour Force Survey (CLFS) shows local PMETs employment has risen steadily since 2015. In fact, as a proportion of the total local workforce, the local PMET share has increased from 54% in 2015 to 58% in 2019.

The number of Employment Pass (EP) holders has historically fluctuated depending on economic conditions.  EP qualifying salaries are also regularly adjusted to safeguard employment of local PMETs.  As a result, local PMET employment has continued to grow while the number of EP holders in Singapore  remained stable, ranging from 187,900 in 2015 to 185,800 in 2018. The latest figure as of Jun 2019 is 189,000.

SDP’s statements seek to mislead Singaporeans

The Singapore economy is continuing to create jobs despite the economic headwinds. Local PMET employment has increased consistently. There is no rising trend of retrenchment, whether amongst PMETs or otherwise.

Given the current uncertain economic climate, it is understandable that some Singaporeans feel anxious about employment prospects and retrenchments. This makes it all the more critical that public debate on the important issue of jobs is based on accurate facts, and not distortions or falsehoods.

These false and misleading statements by the SDP have a singular objective – to stoke fear and anxiety among local PMETs. It is important to set the facts straight so that Singaporeans are not misled.

The Facebook posts by Mr Lim Tean contain false and misleading statements.
 
Falsehood

2. Mr Lim states that “the total pot available to Singaporean students [is] $167 million compared to the $238 million that is spent on foreign students”. He further states that “PAP spends $167 million on Grants & Bursaries for Singaporeans, but $238 million on foreign students??”. These statements imply that MOE spends less on Singaporean students than on foreign students.
 
3. This is false and misleading.
 
4. MOE’s annual budget is $13B, almost all of which is spent on Singapore citizens. The $167M cited by Mr Lim refers only to bursaries for Singaporean tertiary students, and grossly understates MOE’s total spending on Singaporean citizens for education. 

5. The figures of $167M and $238M are therefore not comparable.

6.  The more appropriate comparison should be nearly $13B spent on Singaporean students to provide subsidised education for all Singaporean students at all levels, as against the $238M attributed to foreign students referred to by Mr Lim Tean, which is less than 2% of the total education budget.

7. Further, it should be noted that much of MOE’s budget goes towards costs such as infrastructure, facilities, laboratories, faculty and teaching force, etc., which are either fixed or non-variable up to the medium term, to provide education for Singaporean students. A large part of the $238M attributed to foreign students comprises these fixed and non-variable costs that we have to incur anyway, whether or not we admit a small proportion of foreign students (currently 5%) in the system.

8. This was explained by the Minister for Education in Parliament on 5 August 2019. [https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/government-spending-on-foreign-students]","Additional Clarifications

9. Our admissions system ensures that no Singaporean student is deprived of a place by a foreign student.

The Facebook posts by Mr Lim Tean contain false and misleading statements.
 
Falsehood

2. Mr Lim states that “the total pot available to Singaporean students [is] $167 million compared to the $238 million that is spent on foreign students”. He further states that “PAP spends $167 million on Grants & Bursaries for Singaporeans, but $238 million on foreign students??”. These statements imply that MOE spends less on Singaporean students than on foreign students.
 
3. This is false and misleading.
 
4. MOE’s annual budget is $13B, almost all of which is spent on Singapore citizens. The $167M cited by Mr Lim refers only to bursaries for Singaporean tertiary students, and grossly understates MOE’s total spending on Singaporean citizens for education. 

5. The figures of $167M and $238M are therefore not comparable.

6.  The more appropriate comparison should be nearly $13B spent on Singaporean students to provide subsidised education for all Singaporean students at all levels, as against the $238M attributed to foreign students referred to by Mr Lim Tean, which is less than 2% of the total education budget.

7. Further, it should be noted that much of MOE’s budget goes towards costs such as infrastructure, facilities, laboratories, faculty and teaching force, etc., which are either fixed or non-variable up to the medium term, to provide education for Singaporean students. A large part of the $238M attributed to foreign students comprises these fixed and non-variable costs that we have to incur anyway, whether or not we admit a small proportion of foreign students (currently 5%) in the system.

8. This was explained by the Minister for Education in Parliament on 5 August 2019. [https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/government-spending-on-foreign-students]","Additional Clarifications

9. Our admissions system ensures that no Singaporean student is deprived of a place by a foreign student.

Falsehoods

LFL's allegation that the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) applies the alleged procedure for judicial executions is completely baseless

2. In their statement, LFL falsely asserted that:

“prison officers were instructed to carry out the following brutal procedure whenever the rope breaks during a hanging, which happens from time to time.

a) The prison officer is instructed to pull the rope around the neck of the prisoner towards him.
b) Meanwhile, another prison officer will apply pressure by pulling the body in the opposite direction.
c) The first officer must then kick the back of the neck of the prisoner with great force in order to break it.
d) The officers are told to kick the back of the neck because that would be consistent with death by hanging.
e) The officers are told not to kick more than 2 times, so that there will be no tell-tale marks in case there is an autopsy.
f) Strict orders are also given not to divulge the above to other prison staff not involved in executions.”

3. SPS does not apply the procedure as alleged by LFL for judicial executions. No effort is spared to ensure that all judicial executions in Singapore are carried out in strict compliance with the law. All judicial executions are conducted in the presence of the Superintendent of the Prison and a medical doctor, among others. The law also requires a Coroner (who is a Judicial Officer of the State Courts) to conduct an inquiry within 24 hours of the execution to satisfy himself that the execution was carried out duly and properly. For the record, the rope used for judicial executions has never broken before. This fact alone shows the falsity of LFL's allegations.","Additional Clarifications

4. LFL also made spurious allegations that prison officers were “given special training to carry out the brutal execution method”, that the Singapore Government approved of these ""unlawful methods"", and suggested that specific measures were adopted to cover up these methods. These allegations are entirely unfounded.

5. Prison officers certainly do not receive any “special training to carry out the brutal execution method” as alleged. Any acts such as those described in the LFL statement would have been thoroughly investigated and dealt with.

6. These scurrilous allegations of misconduct follow a series of sensational and untrue stories previously published by LFL. LFL has been publishing various falsehoods to seek attention in hopes of getting Malaysian prisoners, who have been convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death in Singapore, off the death penalty.

Falsehoods
 
At 10.10am on 30 January 2020, The States Times Review said on its Facebook page that Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Transport, Dr Lam Pin Min confirmed that Singapore had run out of face masks, and insinuated that Dr Lam Pin Min was blaming Singaporeans for “insensible and irresponsible” use of surgical masks. Mr Tan also posted that Singapore had run out of masks since last Sunday, less than three days after the first confirmed case.
 
In his Facebook post on 28 January 2020, Dr Lam Pin Min was clearly pictured in a warehouse which showed part of the Government stockpile of surgical masks. His Facebook post also stated clearly that there is sufficient supply of masks if people use them sensibly and responsibly. ","Additional clarifications
 
On 30 January 2020, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said in a press conference that the Singapore Armed Forces would begin packing more than 5.2 million surgical masks this afternoon. The masks would be distributed to local resident households in packets of four surgical masks per household from this Saturday. This clearly indicates that Singapore has not run out of face masks for Singaporeans. During the same press conference, both Minister Lawrence Wong and Mr Chan informed the media that the Government had distributed more than 5 million surgical masks from the stockpile to retailers over the last nine days, which had all been snapped up immediately. 

Although the stockpile is currently sufficient to meet the needs of our public healthcare institutions, we must continue to manage the private usage rate and prioritise the allocation of surgical masks to those who need it the most. This includes our healthcare workers on the frontline and the vulnerable within our society.  The Ministry of Trade and Industry is actively working on identifying new suppliers of surgical masks and will continue to ensure that existing lines of supplies are kept robust.

Falsehoods

On 13 February 2020, STR published a Facebook post on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore claiming that:

The Government is unable to trace the source of infection for any of the infected COVID-19 cases in Singapore;
The Government is ""the only one"" telling the public not to wear a mask;
Each ""China worker"" will also get S$100 a day for 14 days of Leave of Absence, fully paid for by the Singapore government;
Minister for Manpower, Mrs Josephine Teo, said that she was working hard to bring more workers from China into Singapore; and
Seven countries have since banned travel to Singapore, citing lack of confidence in the Singapore government’s public health measures
The above are entirely false, for the following reasons:

First, as of 12:00 pm on 13 Feb 2020, the Ministry of Health (""MOH"") has established through epidemiological investigation and contact tracing that 51 out of the 58 cases have either had travel history to mainland China, or links with previously announced cases. Contact tracing is underway for the remaining seven locally-transmitted cases in an attempt to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to mainland China.
 
Second, MOH's advice that there is no need for individuals who are well to wear a mask is in-line with the World Health Organisation's guidance on the use of masks in the community in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. Health authorities in other countries such as the US and Australia have also expressly advised that they do not recommend that masks be worn by people who are well. As a good hygiene practice, people who are unwell and who have respiratory symptoms should wear a mask so that they minimise the risk of them infecting  others.

Third, Chinese Work Pass holders placed on a mandatory 14-day Leave of Absence (""LOA"") do not receive the $100 daily support. Instead, it is their employer who would receive the support. Under the Leave of Absence Support Programme (""LOASP""), eligible employers can apply for $100 daily per affected worker for the required duration of paid LOA granted to the worker. The LOASP also covers all workers, regardless of nationality. This includes Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Work Pass holders who have travelled to mainland China on or before 31 January 2020, and who were placed on LOA upon their return to Singapore on or after 31 January 2020.

Fourth, at no time did the Minister for Manpower Mrs Josephine Teo say she was working hard to bring more Chinese workers back to Singapore. In fact, the Ministry of Manpower (""MOM"") requires employers of work pass holders with travel history to mainland China to obtain prior approval so as to slow down their workers’ return to Singapore. MOM approved about 200 applications daily for planned arrivals between 9 and 12 Feb 2020, giving priority to applications in essential services like healthcare, transport and waste management so that operations in these sectors are not compromised. Many more applications were rejected.

Fifth, as of 8:00 pm on 13 Feb 2020, no countries have banned travel to Singapore.","Additional Clarifications

All work pass holders with travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days and who are planning to enter/return to Singapore after 2359 hrs on 8 February 2020, will be required to obtain MOM's prior approval before they commence their journey. This is regardless of the nationality of the work pass holder.

Upon arrival in Singapore, all work pass holders with travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days will be placed on mandatory 14-day LOA. Employers will have to arrange for suitable premises to house these returning employees for the duration of their LOA.

In addition, the Singapore Government is working in close cooperation with our foreign counterparts. We have been actively sharing information with our foreign counterparts on Singapore's measures to manage COVID-2019. The international community, businesses and visitors, can be confident in Singapore's commitment to share information openly and swiftly, to protect public health and maintain safety and stability. Singapore has been cited as a positive model in respect of our transparency and response to the COVID-2019 outbreak. In particular, the World Health Organization highlighted the strength of Singapore's response, noting that even before the first case in Singapore was detected, preparedness activities were already underway to rapidly detect and respond to the virus.

2 On 19 February 2020, Goh published a Facebook post alleging that a single

default, and that they have been staying at her sister’s house.
3 On 21 February 2020, TISG published an article and Facebook post on ‘Lina’
reiterating the same claims, after it approached Goh to obtain more details.
4 The claims listed in both articles are entirely false, for the following reasons:
 First, HDB did not evict ‘Lina’ from her rental flat. ‘Lina’ was previously
living in a HDB rental flat with her husband and children. The family did
not have any overdue rent throughout the period of the last tenancy.
‘Lina’’s husband terminated the tenancy for the rental flat and returned
the keys to HDB in early February 2020.
 Second, ‘Lina’ and her husband have bought a new flat from HDB, which
has been paid for in full. ‘Lina’ and her family have since moved into their
new HDB flat. ","Additional Clarifications
5 When HDB staff visited ‘Lina’ and her husband in their new flat on 22 February

subsidies and food rations, from various government agencies and community
partners – the Ministry of Social Development (MSF), the Ministry of Education (MOE),
the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), HDB and the Sembawang Family
Service Centre. The family also received food rations and supermarket vouchers from
their local grassroots organisation.
7 HDB public rental flats cater to needy Singaporean households who have no
other housing options and no family support. HDB works closely with other agencies
and community partners, such as Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres,
to provide support to rental tenants.

UNDER THE PROTECTION FROM ONLINE FALSEHOODS AND MANIPULATION
ACT AGAINST GILBERT GOH AND THE INDEPENDENT SINGAPORE (TISG)
The Minister of National Development has instructed the POFMA Office to issue
Correction Directions (CD) on: (i) a Facebook post by Gilbert Goh (Goh) (19 Feb 2020),
(ii) an article by The Independent Singapore (TISG) on their website (21 Feb 2020),
and (iii) a Facebook post by TISG (21 Feb 2020). They will be required to carry a
correction notice alongside their posts.
Corrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods posted by Gilbert Goh and
TISG
2 On 19 February 2020, Goh published a Facebook post alleging that a single
mother ‘Lina’ and her six children had been evicted from their rental flat due to rental
default, and that they have been staying at her sister’s house.
3 On 21 February 2020, TISG published an article and Facebook post on ‘Lina’
reiterating the same claims, after it approached Goh to obtain more details.
4 The claims listed in both articles are entirely false, for the following reasons:
 First, HDB did not evict ‘Lina’ from her rental flat. ‘Lina’ was previously
living in a HDB rental flat with her husband and children. The family did
not have any overdue rent throughout the period of the last tenancy.
‘Lina’’s husband terminated the tenancy for the rental flat and returned
the keys to HDB in early February 2020.
 Second, ‘Lina’ and her husband have bought a new flat from HDB, which
has been paid for in full. ‘Lina’ and her family have since moved into their
new HDB flat. ","(From POFMA Office Press Release) Additional Clarifications
5 When HDB staff visited ‘Lina’ and her husband in their new flat on 22 February
2020, the couple explained that it was a relative who had approached Goh for
assistance.
6 ‘Lina’ and her family have been receiving assistance, including cash, vouchers,
subsidies and food rations, from various government agencies and community
partners – the Ministry of Social Development (MSF), the Ministry of Education (MOE),
the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA), HDB and the Sembawang Family
Service Centre. The family also received food rations and supermarket vouchers from
their local grassroots organisation.
7 HDB public rental flats cater to needy Singaporean households who have no
other housing options and no family support. HDB works closely with other agencies
and community partners, such as Social Service Offices and Family Service Centres,
to provide support to rental tenants.
8 The false statements reported by Goh and TISG give the impression that HDB
has deprived a needy family of public rental housing because of their inability to pay
for it. This is not the case and it is important to set the facts straight.

Falsehoods

	I. Source of funding for Singapore Airlines' S$15 billion capital raising exercise

In the Facebook post, the author stated, ""Don't be too happy that you have $48b. The bulk of almost 1/3 goes to SIA, 55% TEMASEK OWNED (how did our national carrier became temasek own at 55%???). Cash n immediate release to SIA!” The author has claimed that almost one third of the support provided under the Resilience Budget will be provided to Singapore Airlines (""SIA""). This is false. 

SIA's S$15 billion capital raising exercise, announced on 26 March 2020, is distinct and separate from the Resilience Budget, and is not funded by the Government.

	II. Use of S$17 billion from Past Reserves

The author also stated in the Facebook Post, ""...president halimah open reserves of $17b is mainly for Temasek.” In this statement, the author has claimed that the S$17 billion from Singapore’s Past Reserves will be used mainly for Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (""Temasek""). This is also false.

To support the Resilience Budget, the Government is proposing to draw up to S$17 billion from our Past Reserves for broad-based economy-wide and sector-wide schemes. The schemes drawing on Past Reserves are:

	Economy-wide Support Measures

Enhancement of Jobs Support Scheme (S$13.8b)
Enhancement of financing schemes (S$1.7b)
Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (S$1.2b)
	Sector-wide Support Measure
Aviation Support Package (S$0.4b)
None of the above schemes are ring-fenced to be for Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (“Temasek”) or Temasek-linked companies.","Additional Clarifications

The Government has set aside a total of S$48.4 billion in the Resilience Budget to (i) save jobs, support workers, and protect livelihoods, (ii) help enterprises overcome immediate challenges, and (iii) strengthen economic and social resilience so that we can emerge intact and stronger.

In particular, S$20.0 billion has been set aside in the form of loan capital, to support good companies with strong capabilities and to catalyse private sector loan capital. None of this S$20 billion set aside as loan capital will be used by the Government to subscribe to SIA’s fund-raising exercise announced on 26 March 2020.

S$13.8 billion will go towards enhancing and extending the Jobs Support Scheme (""JSS""), to provide more impactful and sustained wage support for businesses. The JSS covers all sectors, with severely impacted sectors such as aviation, tourism and Food and Beverages (“F&B”) getting additional support. Eligible individuals and households will also benefit under the new Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme, as well as the enhanced Care and Support Package.

This is false. The police officers were in fact rendering assistance to the delivery rider who had approached them for help. The GrabFood delivery rider had thought that items were stolen from his motorcycle and approached the Police officers for help.

Falsehoods

On 18 April 2020, Singapore States Times published a Facebook post on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore claiming that:

The number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection on 17 April was 1,146, and the total number of confirmed cases was 5,573;
Health Minister Mr Gan Kim Yong ordered the reported numbers to be halved to minimise public panic, by reporting numbers in the afternoon instead of later at night;
The Singapore Government earlier covered up the number of uncontactable suspect cases, then covered up the flight information and profiles of imported cases, and subsequently tried to cover up the total number of cases by reporting only the number of discharged cases and daily increases; and
The States Times Review (STR) had called out the Government and Ministry of Health (MOH) on the cover up and MOH had to comply with STR’s post.

The above are false, for the following reasons:

There were 623 new cases of COVID-19 infection as of 12pm on 17 April 2020, which brought the total number of cases to 5,050. It is false that there were 1,146 new cases. There was no instruction given by the Minister for Health or the Government to halve or under-report the number of cases. For the purpose of updating the number of new cases of COVID-19 per 24-hour period, MOH has always used 12pm as the cut-off time since the onset of COVID-19.
There is no cover-up by the Government or MOH. MOH’s daily press releases publish information on all confirmed cases, including the number of imported cases, and the linked and unlinked cases at that point in time, even as contact tracing and epidemiological investigations are ongoing. MOH also publishes reports on the daily situation as well as an overview of the cases via the case summary table and dashboard which can be publicly accessed on MOH’s website.
MOH does not act and has not acted in compliance with any of STR‘s posts.","Additional Clarifications

Contact tracing is a rigorous and time-intensive process, especially as case numbers increase. As there is significant public interest particularly in the number of new COVID-19 infections daily, MOH has started releasing top line numbers (i.e., the gross number of new cases which have been preliminarily confirmed) in the afternoon of each day, even as contact tracing and investigations continue. Subsequently, further updates and details of those cases are shared via the MOH press release issued later on the same night.

MOH also publishes reports on the daily situation as well as an overview of the cases via the case summary table and dashboard which can be publicly accessed on MOH’s website.
MOH does not act and has not acted in compliance with any of STR‘s posts.","Additional Clarifications

Contact tracing is a rigorous and time-intensive process, especially as case numbers increase. As there is significant public interest particularly in the number of new COVID-19 infections daily, MOH has started releasing top line numbers (i.e., the gross number of new cases which have been preliminarily confirmed) in the afternoon of each day, even as contact tracing and investigations continue. Subsequently, further updates and details of those cases are shared via the MOH press release issued later on the same night.

All of the above claims are false. Please refer to https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/news-and-views/news-room/statements/2020/temasek-compensation-framework.","Additional Clarifications

The Government does not set the remuneration of staff in Temasek; this is the responsibility of its Board and management. The Government holds the Board responsible for the long-term performance of its investments, net of expenses. 

In the case of Temasek, its Board Committee, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee (“LDCC”), is responsible for the establishment of guidelines and policies on performance measurement and compensation plans. In addition, remuneration of the Executive Directors of Temasek Holdings is approved by LDCC and endorsed by its Board.

Temasek’s remuneration framework balances reward for short-term performance and long-term value creation. This has been disclosed in Temasek’s Review since 2008. Temasek’s compensation is benchmarked to the industry and the compensation framework comprises a base salary, as well as short-term, medium-term and long-term incentives. Part of the bonuses are deferred and subject to clawback should Temasek’s returns be negative.

Falsehood

On 4 May 2020, SST published a Facebook post stating that “Education Minister Ong Ye Kung is responsible for numerous infections in schools after he refused to close down the schools. The schools were only closed on April 3rd, but at least 50 students and teachers were already infected.” These statements imply that at least 50 students and teachers had become infected with COVID-19 by 3 April 2020 as a result of transmission in schools, which is false.

As of 3 April 2020, 69 students and staff in MOE schools, including the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), were reported to have been infected with COVID-19. Based on contact tracing and investigations by MOH, all the cases (except for 3 which are still unlinked) were attributed to transmission via overseas travel, within households, social settings, and a non-school workplace (for a part-time student). In short, none of the 69 infections were traced back to MOE schools, including the IHLs.","Additional Clarifications

Even before the implementation of Full Home-Based Learning (HBL) as part of the broader national Circuit Breaker measures, our schools and teachers have put in tremendous effort to ensure that our students can learn in a safe environment. Precautionary measures included establishing new hygiene and cleaning routines for our students, fixed seating and assigned play areas, suspension of co-curricular activities, and placing students who are unwell, have a travel history, or who stay with family members who have a travel history, on a Leave of Absence.

As part of the national Circuit Breaker measures, schools were closed and we moved to Full HBL on 8 April 2020. With most parents telecommuting from home, the closure of schools did not become a major disruption to our lives. Although students no longer attend school physically, the restrictions in place prevented them from moving around the community freely and exposing themselves to the virus.  Nevertheless, a major concern with school closure is our students from vulnerable backgrounds, who need the support of schools for lessons, meals and guidance. These students, together with students whose parents work in essential services, have therefore been allowed to come back to school for care and supervision, with the necessary safe distancing measures in place. The arrangements for these students will continue during the May school holidays.

The Declarations will come into effect on 7 May 2020.

2. Under the Declarations, the SST’s and Tan’s Facebook pages are required to carry a notice stating that they have been declared DOLs. With the notice, visitors to both Facebook pages will be warned that the pages have a history of communicating falsehoods. The Declaration will also make it an offence for both SST and Tan to derive benefit from operating the Facebook pages, and prohibit the provision of financial support to them for the purposes of supporting, helping or promoting the communication of falsehoods.

3. The SST’s and Tan’s Facebook pages have repeatedly communicated numerous falsehoods, of which at least three on each page were the subject of POFMA Directions from November 2019 to date. These include falsehoods regarding (1) COVID-19 cases in schools (POFMA Direction issued on 5 May 2020); (2) MOH’s reporting of COVID-19 cases in Singapore (POFMA Direction issued on 18 Apr 2020); (3) payment of salaries for quarantined migrant workers in the context of the COVID-19 situation in Singapore (POFMA Direction issued on 6 Apr 2020); and (4) NUSSU’s FB page and allegations of abuse of Police powers (POFMA Direction issued on 28 Nov 2019).

SST and Tan have refused to comply with any of the Directions issued to them. In recent months, both Facebook pages have communicated falsehoods regarding the COVID-19 virus situation in Singapore. Both Facebook pages are linked to other websites that are operated by Tan, which derive monetary benefits from these falsehoods at the expense of Singaporeans and our society.

The Declarations will come into effect on 7 May 2020.

2. Under the Declarations, the SST’s and Tan’s Facebook pages are required to carry a notice stating that they have been declared DOLs. With the notice, visitors to both Facebook pages will be warned that the pages have a history of communicating falsehoods. The Declaration will also make it an offence for both SST and Tan to derive benefit from operating the Facebook pages, and prohibit the provision of financial support to them for the purposes of supporting, helping or promoting the communication of falsehoods.

3. The SST’s and Tan’s Facebook pages have repeatedly communicated numerous falsehoods, of which at least three on each page were the subject of POFMA Directions from November 2019 to date. These include falsehoods regarding (1) COVID-19 cases in schools (POFMA Direction issued on 5 May 2020); (2) MOH’s reporting of COVID-19 cases in Singapore (POFMA Direction issued on 18 Apr 2020); (3) payment of salaries for quarantined migrant workers in the context of the COVID-19 situation in Singapore (POFMA Direction issued on 6 Apr 2020); and (4) NUSSU’s FB page and allegations of abuse of Police powers (POFMA Direction issued on 28 Nov 2019).

SST and Tan have refused to comply with any of the Directions issued to them. In recent months, both Facebook pages have communicated falsehoods regarding the COVID-19 virus situation in Singapore. Both Facebook pages are linked to other websites that are operated by Tan, which derive monetary benefits from these falsehoods at the expense of Singaporeans and our society.

A YouTube video by Mr Thum Ping Tjin contains several false and misleading statements.

Falsehoods

2.     On 8 May 2020, Mr Thum published a YouTube video episode of The Show by PJ Thum on the New Naratif YouTube channel, claiming, amongst other things, the following.

a.     Under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), the definition of “false” means that “even if one bit is found to be wrong or misleading, the whole statement can be considered false. The definition is so broad that the omission of a fact, accidentally or otherwise, is sufficient for something to be considered misleading. The problem is, it’s impossible to include every single fact about anything in the statement. You can’t! And even if you could, anyone could selectively quote it, so that what they quote is misleading. So under this law, every statement can be considered false in some way”.

b.     POFMA makes all criticisms of the Government illegal.

c.     There is no recourse in law for the Court to overturn a POFMA direction if it is an abuse of the powers under POFMA.

d.     POFMA “means that the truth will be whatever the party says it is”.1

3.     The above are false, for the following reasons:

POFMA applies only to factual statements that are false (Section 2(2) of POFMA). It does not apply to opinions. If there is a dispute as to whether the statement is false, or whether it is a statement of fact, the dispute can be determined by the Courts. Further, the whole statement will not be considered false, automatically, just because “one bit” of it is false. The Courts have, over centuries, developed criteria for assessing falsehoods. It is untrue to say that “every statement can be considered false in some way” and be subject to POFMA.
Criticisms which are opinions and not statements of fact are not covered by POFMA (Section 2(2)(a) of POFMA). Criticisms which are based on true facts, are also not covered by POFMA. POFMA only applies to falsehoods. It is untrue (and absurd) to say that POFMA makes all criticisms of the Government illegal. Before and after POFMA came into force, there have been criticisms of the Government (including by Mr Thum), on a regular basis. They have not been the subject of POFMA.
The Courts have judicial oversight of the exercise of powers under POFMA. It is therefore untrue to say that there can be no recourse in law, when there has been abuse of POFMA powers
For the above reasons, it is also false for Mr Thum to assert that POFMA “means that the truth will be whatever the party says it is.”1
4.     Mr Thum also states that POFMA has been used against the “interpretation of statistical data” by the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP). This is also false. The issue was not about interpretation of statistics. The SDP had made a direct, false statement. (See MOM’s clarification in the said SDP case.)  SDP challenged the POFMA directions against it, and the High Court held that there was no basis for the directions to be set aside, because SDP had made false statements of fact. The High Court’s judgment is publicly available.","Additional Clarifications

5.     Contrary to what Mr Thum suggests, people are free to criticise and disagree with the Government.

6.     POFMA has been used to deal specifically with falsehoods, which suggested that the Government is mismanaging public funds, abusing police power, favouring foreigners over locals, and carrying out judicial executions in an unlawful, brutal manner, among others. The consequences that such falsehoods about public institutions can have on society were extensively set out in the Government’s Green Paper, the Select Committee Report, and the Second Reading speech for POFMA. Those interested can look at this material and form their own views as to whether, as Mr Thum claims, POFMA has been used in a manner inconsistent with government assurances.

7.     POFMA has enabled these falsehoods to be corrected in a targeted manner. Powers under POFMA are in fact narrower than pre-existing legislation dealing with falsehoods.

8.     Further, so far, the primary approach has been to issue Correction Directions under POFMA.2 Where a Correction Direction has been issued, the original article remains completely accessible. Readers can read for themselves both the primary piece and the correction, and make up their own minds. Recipients of POFMA directions who put up the Correction Notice can continue to put forward their point of view on the issue, and their original articles also remain available for anyone to read.

 

9.     POFMA was used against COVID-19-related falsehoods in 11 of the 18 POFMA cases to date. In 7 of these cases, directions were issued within 24 hours, sometimes in a matter of hours.

 

10.     Mr Thum states that the court process takes a long time. But, as the Government has said, POFMA’s Rules provide for the High Court hearing to be held 6 working days after the originating summons is filed in court, which is expedited, compared with the usual process which could take some months.  As the Government has also said, there are no hearing fees for the first three days (if the hearing does take three days), and the Court will have the power to waive any further fees. For individuals, filing fees are lower than ordinary court fees. The Government had also explained that how long the hearing takes, and how long the Courts take to decide, are matters for the Courts; Parliament and the Executive cannot intervene in those.

 

11.     Mr Thum also misleadingly uses a video clip of an interview with the Minister for Law to suggest that POFMA can be easily abused by a future government. He  omits the first part of the Minister’s answer, which is that “first of all, there are checks… the courts have oversight of it. So there is a clear oversight mechanism (and) checks.”

 

12.     Contrary to what Mr Thum said, the Government did not try to apply the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act retroactively in Mr Li Shengwu’s case. The substantive law applicable to the case was common law contempt, and not the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act.

 

13.     Mr Thum claims that “past PAP governments have spread misinformation to silence critics, like in Operation Spectrum.” These are his opinions (and thus not subject to a POFMA Direction).  Similar claims have been refuted elsewhere.

 

14.     Public clarifications on POFMA have been put out by the Government, repeatedly. Yet, in the past year, Mr Thum has on multiple occasions repeated falsehoods and misleading statements similar to those in this case. He is clearly aware of what the true scope of POFMA is: when a viewer asked whether his criticisms of the government may be false, he shrugged off the suggestion, stating that “POFMA is supposed to only be used against ‘false statements of facts’,” meaning, his opinions cannot be the subject of POFMA.  Thus his statements (set out in para 2 above), that POFMA can be used in respect of all statements, are entirely cynical, and he obviously knows that they are untrue.

 

15.     Under the Correction Directions issued to Mr Thum and New Naratif, the 8 May video can remain accessible to the public. That gives the lie to any suggestion of censorship. It will allow viewers to view his video, and this statement, and reach their own conclusions.

A post on the NTS Facebook page contains several false and misleading statements. The NTS page is run by Mr Alex Tan, who lives in Australia, and claims to be an Australian citizen.

Falsehoods

2. On 15 May 2020, NTS published a post, claiming, amongst other things, the following:

a. “Every criticism has been outlawed by the Singapore government through its new POFMA1 legislation, where the politicians in power get to decide what is truth.” 

b. The Minister for Law had issued a POFMA direction to ban a video.

3. The above are false, for the following reasons:

• It is false that “politicians in power get to decide what is truth” under POFMA. This had previously been explained when an earlier POFMA direction was issued. POFMA applies only to factual statements that are false (Section 2(2) of POFMA). It does not apply to opinions. If there is a dispute as to whether the statement is false, or whether it is a statement of fact, the dispute can be determined by the Courts. The Courts have, over centuries, developed criteria for assessing falsehoods, and will be the final arbiters of whether there is a falsehood under POFMA.

• For the reasons above, it is therefore also untrue to say that POFMA outlaws every criticism of the Government. Before and after POFMA came into force, the Government has been regularly criticised on various matters. These criticisms have not been subject to POFMA.

• The Minister for Law has not issued a POFMA direction to ban any video. The video subject to an earlier POFMA direction remains accessible to the public.","Additional Clarifications

4. Mr Tan repeats falsehoods that were subject to an earlier POFMA direction. In light of that earlier direction, Mr Tan must be aware that these statements are false and tend to undermine the public interest. Yet, he continues to publish falsehoods that distort the public’s understanding of the law and how it has been implemented.

5. Mr Tan makes serious and baseless allegations about Singapore’s judiciary being biased. These have been brought to the attention of the Attorney-General’s Chambers for assessment on whether the allegations are in contempt of court.

6. Mr Tan also claims that the Minister for Law faces criminal charges in Malaysia, and that a Malaysian court has made an order against the Minister for Law. These are untrue.

7. Mr Tan has previously been issued POFMA correction directions in relation to falsehoods conveyed on 6 separate occasions on his previous Facebook pages, the States Times Review and Singapore States Times. This demonstrates a clear pattern of deliberately spreading falsehoods which affect the public interest. The majority of these falsehoods related to the COVID-19 situation, including falsehoods suggesting that Singapore had run out of face masks, that there was an underreporting of COVID-19 cases here by the Government, that there were numerous infections because schools were not closed earlier and that foreign workers were not getting paid during quarantine.

8. Mr Tan was bound to comply with these correction directions, but has refused to comply. His previous pages were declared as declared online locations (Section 32 of POFMA) and subject to access disabling orders (Section 34 of POFMA) after his repeated non-compliance with the law.

A post on the NTS Facebook page contains several false and misleading statements. The NTS page is run by Mr Alex Tan, who lives in Australia, and claims to be an Australian citizen.

Falsehoods

2. On 15 May 2020, NTS published a post, claiming, amongst other things, the following:

a. “Every criticism has been outlawed by the Singapore government through its new POFMA1 legislation, where the politicians in power get to decide what is truth.” 

b. The Minister for Law had issued a POFMA direction to ban a video.

3. The above are false, for the following reasons:

• It is false that “politicians in power get to decide what is truth” under POFMA. This had previously been explained when an earlier POFMA direction was issued. POFMA applies only to factual statements that are false (Section 2(2) of POFMA). It does not apply to opinions. If there is a dispute as to whether the statement is false, or whether it is a statement of fact, the dispute can be determined by the Courts. The Courts have, over centuries, developed criteria for assessing falsehoods, and will be the final arbiters of whether there is a falsehood under POFMA.

• For the reasons above, it is therefore also untrue to say that POFMA outlaws every criticism of the Government. Before and after POFMA came into force, the Government has been regularly criticised on various matters. These criticisms have not been subject to POFMA.

• The Minister for Law has not issued a POFMA direction to ban any video. The video subject to an earlier POFMA direction remains accessible to the public.","Additional Clarifications

4. Mr Tan repeats falsehoods that were subject to an earlier POFMA direction. In light of that earlier direction, Mr Tan must be aware that these statements are false and tend to undermine the public interest. Yet, he continues to publish falsehoods that distort the public’s understanding of the law and how it has been implemented.

5. Mr Tan makes serious and baseless allegations about Singapore’s judiciary being biased. These have been brought to the attention of the Attorney-General’s Chambers for assessment on whether the allegations are in contempt of court.

6. Mr Tan also claims that the Minister for Law faces criminal charges in Malaysia, and that a Malaysian court has made an order against the Minister for Law. These are untrue.

7. Mr Tan has previously been issued POFMA correction directions in relation to falsehoods conveyed on 6 separate occasions on his previous Facebook pages, the States Times Review and Singapore States Times. This demonstrates a clear pattern of deliberately spreading falsehoods which affect the public interest. The majority of these falsehoods related to the COVID-19 situation, including falsehoods suggesting that Singapore had run out of face masks, that there was an underreporting of COVID-19 cases here by the Government, that there were numerous infections because schools were not closed earlier and that foreign workers were not getting paid during quarantine.

8. Mr Tan was bound to comply with these correction directions, but has refused to comply. His previous pages were declared as declared online locations (Section 32 of POFMA) and subject to access disabling orders (Section 34 of POFMA) after his repeated non-compliance with the law. Mr Tan remains recalcitrant, and continues to purvey falsehoods, on his latest page.

The Minister for Communications and Information has today declared the National Times Singapore (NTS) Facebook page a Declared Online Location (DOL) under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). The Declaration will come into effect on 29 May 2020.

2. Under the Declaration, the NTS Facebook page, which is operated by Mr Alex Tan, is required to carry a notice stating that it has been declared a DOL. With the notice, visitors to the Facebook page will be warned that it has a history of communicating falsehoods. The Declaration will also make it an offence for Tan to derive benefit from operating the NTS Facebook page, and will prohibit the provision of financial support to it for the purposes of supporting, helping or promoting the communication of falsehoods.

3. The NTS Facebook page communicated numerous false statements of fact in a post published on 15 May 20201, at least three of which were the subject of a POFMA Direction. In recent months, Tan has created and operated Facebook pages which sought to derive monetary benefits from falsehoods at the expense of Singaporeans and our society. These pages have been declared DOLs2. So far, neither these pages nor Tan have complied with any of the requirements of the POFMA Directions and Declarations that they have been served with.

The Minister for Communications and Information has directed POFMA Office to order Facebook to disable Singapore users’ access to the National Times Singapore (NTS) Facebook page, under Section 34 of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).

2. The NTS Facebook page, which is operated by Mr Alex Tan, has communicated at least three false statements of fact. It has not complied with the POFMA Direction that it was served with for a post published on 15 May 20201. After being notified on 28 May 2020 that it had been declared a Declared Online Location (DOL), the page has not complied with the Declaration’s requirement to publish a notice stating that it has been declared a DOL. The notice serves to warn visitors to the NTS Facebook page of the falsehoods that the page has communicated.

This is false for the following reasons:

The Government has not proposed, planned nor targeted for Singapore to increase its population to 10 million;
The Government does not have any population target; and
URA’s underground plans are not meant to serve any population target.
 

The Government has clarified Singapore’s population plans on multiple occasions: (i) in Parliament in March 2018, when it stated Singapore’s total population is likely to be significantly below 6.9 million by 2030 (ii) in two Factually articles (“What is the aim of Government population policies?” in March 2020, and “Does the Government have a population target e.g. 10 million?” in July 2020), and (iii) in a media statement issued by the National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) on 1 July 2020. The media statement also stated that the publication of such falsehoods damages the public interest by undermining legitimate and honest discussion, and that appropriate action may be taken against any further publication of such falsehoods.

Falsehoods

The NUSS forum video, TOC’s Facebook post and videos, CNA online article and New Naratif audio recording featured the following claims by Dr Paul Tambyah:

MOM issued a statement to all the employers that if they brought their foreign workers for COVID-19 testing, they would lose their work pass privileges.
MOM actively discouraged the testing of workers.
MOM made these decisions without consulting public health medical professionals or MOH.
The statements above are false for the following reasons:

In its advisory to employers, MOM did not say that employers could not bring their workers for testing. Neither did MOM actively discourage the testing of workers. What MOM said was: “Do not send workers to hospitals unless it is a medical emergency. If the worker is unwell, employers should send him to a general practitioner to seek medical attention, who will make a proper assessment on whether the worker needs to be sent to the hospital.”

The MOM advisory also did not state that employers who brought their workers for testing would lose their work pass privileges. What MOM said was: “Our hospitals are working hard to ensure that medical emergencies are handled promptly. We encourage you to be socially responsible and only send workers to the hospital if it is a medical emergency as doing so otherwise will deny immediate treatment to those who need it. Employers who act irresponsibly by misusing medical facility may have their work pass privileges suspended.”

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce, led by the Ministers and staffed by senior public officials and medical professionals, was set up in Jan 2020 to direct the national whole-of-government response to COVID-19, to ensure smooth coordination across Ministries and all affected sectors.

Decisions made on the management of foreign workers and advisories, including the decision to issue the above MOM advisory to employers, were guided by MOH and its medical professionals, based on the prevailing scientific evidence and local situation.
In a Facebook post [1] on 25 April 2020, Minister for Manpower Mrs Josephine Teo clarified that the MOM advisory was “to ask employers not to send their workers who are healthy for testing” at hospitals, that “Our regular doctors are better able to pick up early signs and order tests if necessary”, and that the advisory was sent out at the request of MOH.

On 8 February 2020, Changi General Hospital (CGH) informed MOH that an employer in the construction industry was sending all his workers to the CGH A&E Department to be tested for COVID-19 though the workers exhibited no symptoms and were well. The employer also asked for memos from CGH to certify that the workers were not infected with COVID-19 and were fit to work. The hospital was concerned that this would trigger a flood of well workers being sent to A&E Departments, distracting hospitals from the care and treatment of ill patients who required their attention. On 12 February 2020, MOH, MOM and other agencies jointly issued an advisory to the industry to advise that there was no need to prevent workers who were residing in the dormitory from working if they are not unwell.
Subsequently, the hospitals informed MOH that employers were still sending workers who were healthy for testing. MOH then informed MOM, and a further advisory was sent out on 19 February 2020 to advise employers not to send their workers who were healthy for testing, to ensure that medical facilities and resources were focused on unwell individuals who needed medical treatment. This advice was based on the prevailing scientific evidence at that time, which was also in line with MOH’s risk-based approach to prioritise testing and care for those who are of high risk.

Falsehoods

The NUSS forum video, TOC’s Facebook post and videos, CNA online article and New Naratif audio recording featured the following claims by Dr Paul Tambyah:

MOM issued a statement to all the employers that if they brought their foreign workers for COVID-19 testing, they would lose their work pass privileges.
MOM actively discouraged the testing of workers.
MOM made these decisions without consulting public health medical professionals or MOH.
The statements above are false for the following reasons:

In its advisory to employers, MOM did not say that employers could not bring their workers for testing. Neither did MOM actively discourage the testing of workers. What MOM said was: “Do not send workers to hospitals unless it is a medical emergency. If the worker is unwell, employers should send him to a general practitioner to seek medical attention, who will make a proper assessment on whether the worker needs to be sent to the hospital.”

The MOM advisory also did not state that employers who brought their workers for testing would lose their work pass privileges. What MOM said was: “Our hospitals are working hard to ensure that medical emergencies are handled promptly. We encourage you to be socially responsible and only send workers to the hospital if it is a medical emergency as doing so otherwise will deny immediate treatment to those who need it. Employers who act irresponsibly by misusing medical facility may have their work pass privileges suspended.”

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce, led by the Ministers and staffed by senior public officials and medical professionals, was set up in Jan 2020 to direct the national whole-of-government response to COVID-19, to ensure smooth coordination across Ministries and all affected sectors.

Decisions made on the management of foreign workers and advisories, including the decision to issue the above MOM advisory to employers, were guided by MOH and its medical professionals, based on the prevailing scientific evidence and local situation.
In a Facebook post [1] on 25 April 2020, Minister for Manpower Mrs Josephine Teo clarified that the MOM advisory was “to ask employers not to send their workers who are healthy for testing” at hospitals, that “Our regular doctors are better able to pick up early signs and order tests if necessary”, and that the advisory was sent out at the request of MOH. As the Minister’s Facebook post was published before Dr Paul Tambyah’s remarks, Dr Tambyah could have easily verified beforehand what the correct facts were.

ISSUANCE OF CORRECTION DIRECTIONS UNDER THE PROTECTION FROM ONLINE FALSEHOODS AND MANIPULATION ACT ON FALSEHOODS ON COVID-19 VACCINATION
The Ministry of Health (MOH) is aware of falsehoods circulating that the COVID- 19 vaccination has clear and causal links with stroke and heart attack. There are also third parties who have exploited the sharing of personal experiences by individuals, by reposting these personal accounts and making unsubstantiated claims about vaccine- related adverse reactions. They often continue to do so despite the original posts being removed or made private.
2. The Minister for Health has instructed the POFMA Office to issue Correction Directions on: (i) Facebook posts published on the Facebook pages of Goh Meng Seng (Satu Singapura) and Goh Meng Seng People’s Power Party on 2 April 2021 and 7 April 2021; and (ii) an article by Singapore Uncensored published on their website and their Facebook page on 7 April 2021. They will be required to carry a correction notice alongside their posts.
Corrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods posted by Goh Meng Seng and Singapore Uncensored
3. There are false statements on COVID-19 vaccination contained in multiple Facebook posts and a website, namely:
i. Posts published on the Facebook pages of Goh Meng Seng (Satu Singapura) and Goh Meng Seng People’s Power Party on 2 April 2021, implying that COVID-19 vaccination had caused or substantially contributed to a stroke suffered by a doctor;
ii. Posts published on the Facebook pages of Goh Meng Seng (Satu Singapura) and Goh Meng Seng People’s Power Party on 7 April 2021, implying that COVID-19 vaccination had caused or substantially contributed to the death of an 81-year-old man; and
iii. An article published on the Singapore Uncensored website on 7 April 2021 (and subsequently shared on the Facebook page of Singapore Uncensored the same day) stating that an 81-year-old man had passed away from alleged vaccination complications.
4. These allegations are false. As of 14 April 2021, there is no credible evidence for an increased risk of heart attack or stroke with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines which are currently approved and offered in Singapore.
5. The medical team caring for the doctor has assessed that the doctor’s current condition is highly unlikely to be related to the COVID-19 vaccination, and Mount Elizabeth Hospital had issued a clarification on 4 April 2021.
6. The cause of death of the 81-year-old man was ischaemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to the heart muscles). The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) Forensic Medicine Division has reported that based on the post-mortem, there was no evidence of acute anaphylaxis or an allergic reaction at the injection site of the COVID- 19 vaccine. There was extensive narrowing of the three main blood vessels supplying blood to the muscles of the heart due to atherosclerosis (build up of plaques over time in the blood vessels that obstruct blood flow).
7. For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article “Corrections and Clarifications Regarding Falsehoods on COVID-19 Vaccination” at https://www.gov.sg/article/factually150421
8. COVID-19 vaccines that are used in Singapore have been assessed to be safe and efficacious by both the HSA and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination. Medical teams are well-equipped and measures are in place at all vaccination sites to ensure the safety of vaccine recipients pre-, during, and post-vaccination. All vaccine- related incidents are taken seriously and healthcare professionals are required to report these incidents expediently to the MOH and HSA.

Falsehoods

MOH is aware of falsehoods circulating that the COVID-19 vaccination has clear and causal links with stroke and heart attack. In particular, there are allegations that a doctor had suffered a stroke and an 81-year-old man had passed away from heart attack as a consequence and result of receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. These allegations are false. 

We also note that there are third parties who have exploited the sharing of personal experiences by individuals, by reposting these personal accounts and making unsubstantiated claims about vaccine-related adverse reactions. They often continue to do so despite the original posts being removed or made private.

 

Facts

As of 14 April 2021, there is no credible evidence for an increased risk of heart attack or stroke with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines which are currently approved and offered in Singapore. 

The medical team caring for the doctor has assessed that the doctor’s current condition is highly unlikely to be related to the COVID-19 vaccination, and Mount Elizabeth Hospital had issued a clarification on 4 April 2021.

The cause of death of the 81-year-old man was ischaemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to the heart muscles). The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) Forensic Medicine Division has reported that based on post-mortem, there was no evidence of acute anaphylaxis or an allergic reaction at the injection site of the COVID-19 vaccine. There was extensive narrowing of the 3 main blood vessels supplying blood to the muscles of the heart due to atherosclerosis (build up of plaques over time in the blood vessels that obstruct blood flow).

COVID-19 vaccines that are used in Singapore have been assessed to be safe and efficacious by both the HSA and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination. Medical teams are well-equipped and measures are in place at all vaccination sites to ensure the safety of vaccine recipients pre-, during, and post-vaccination. All vaccine-related incidents are taken seriously and healthcare professionals are required to report these incidents expediently to the Ministry of Health and HSA. 

 

Additional Clarifications

The Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 Vaccination (VIFAP) provides one-time goodwill financial assistance to persons who experience serious side effects that are assessed to be related to COVID-19 vaccine administered in Singapore. To apply for VIFAP, individuals will need to submit an application accompanied by medical information on the serious side effect from their treating doctor. As the severity of serious side effects can be broad-ranging and the clinical assessment by doctors may vary, all VIFAP applications will be assessed and adjudicated by a MOH-appointed independent clinical panel comprising experts in relevant fields such as neurology, immunology, and infectious diseases. The VIFAP is not meant to reimburse medical costs. It provides an additional layer on financial support, on top of the existing government healthcare financing schemes for medical costs incurred, which include government subsidies, MediShield Life, MediSave, and MediFund.

Additional Clarifications

The Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 Vaccination (VIFAP) provides one-time goodwill financial assistance to persons who experience serious side effects that are assessed to be related to COVID-19 vaccine administered in Singapore. To apply for VIFAP, individuals will need to submit an application accompanied by medical information on the serious side effect from their treating doctor. As the severity of serious side effects can be broad-ranging and the clinical assessment by doctors may vary, all VIFAP applications will be assessed and adjudicated by a MOH-appointed independent clinical panel comprising experts in relevant fields such as neurology, immunology, and infectious diseases. The VIFAP is not meant to reimburse medical costs. It provides an additional layer on financial support, on top of the existing government healthcare financing schemes for medical costs incurred, which include government subsidies, MediShield Life, MediSave, and MediFund.

The Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 Vaccination (VIFAP) provides one-time goodwill financial assistance to persons who experience serious side effects that are assessed to be related to COVID-19 vaccine administered in Singapore. To apply for VIFAP, individuals will need to submit an application accompanied by medical information on the serious side effect from their treating doctor. As the severity of serious side effects can be broad-ranging and the clinical assessment by doctors may vary, all VIFAP applications will be assessed and adjudicated by a MOH-appointed independent clinical panel comprising experts in relevant fields such as neurology, immunology, and infectious diseases. The VIFAP is not meant to reimburse medical costs. It provides an additional layer on financial support, on top of the existing government healthcare financing schemes for medical costs incurred, which include government subsidies, MediShield Life, MediSave, and MediFund.

SINGAPORE DEMOCRATIC PARTY’S POFMA APPEAL
The Minister for Manpower (MOM) has issued a new Correction Direction (CD)
under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (“POFMA”)
to the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) in relation to the false statement of fact
contained in SDP’s 2 December 2019 Facebook post, following the Court of Appeal’s
judgment on SDP’s appeal.
2 The SDP was issued three CDs on 14 December 2019 for falsehoods on their
Facebook posts and an article on their website titled “SDP Population Policy: Hire
S’poreans First, Retrench S’poreans last”.
3 The subject statement identified in three of the CDs was “Local PMET
retrenchment has been increasing” (“first subject statement”). An additional subject
statement identified in the third CD was “Local PMET employment has gone down”
(“second subject statement”).
4 The SDP applied to the High Court, and thereafter appealed to the Court of
Appeal (CA), to set aside the CDs. The CA upheld all three CDs in respect of the
first subject statement, and dismissed the SDP’s appeal in this regard. This
statement was false as shown by MOM’s data, which SDP did not challenge.
5 The CA allowed a part of the SDP’s appeal with respect to the third CD in
relation to the second subject statement. This is because the CA found that the term
“Local PMET employment” used in the infographic in SDP’s 2 December 2019
Facebook is to be understood as referring only to Singapore citizen PMETs, instead of
both Singapore citizens and permanent residents.
6 However, even if we consider only the employment of Singapore citizens in
PMET jobs, SDP’s statement that such employment has gone down is still
completely false. The number of Singapore citizens employed in PMETs jobs has
increased steadily from 2015 to 2019 (see Chart 1). As such, the Minister for
Manpower has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a Correction Direction to the SDP
in relation to this false statement of fact found in SDP’s 2 December 2019
Facebook post.

7 For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article here.
## End of Release ##","The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) published two Facebook posts and an article on the SDP’s website regarding Singapore’s population policy that contain falsehoods. In addition, SDP paid for both posts to be boosted as advertisements on Facebook. Both posts are linked to an article on the SDP’s website titled, “SDP Population Policy: Hire S’poreans First, Retrench S’poreans last”.

One of the Facebook posts includes a graphical illustration depicting plunging “Local PMET Employment”. In the Court of Appeal’s judgment in The Online Citizen Pte Ltd v Attorney-General and another appeal and other matters [2021] SGCA 96 (“CA Judgment”), it has been held that the reference to “Local PMET Employment” in this graphic is to Singapore Citizen PMET employment.

It is wrong that Singapore Citizen PMET employment has decreased. As reported in the Ministry of Manpower’s Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, Singapore Citizen PMET employment has risen steadily since 2015.

The article on the SDP’s website titled, “SDP Population Policy: Hire S’poreans First, Retrench S’poreans last”, contains the statement: “The SDP’s proposal comes amidst a rising proportion of Singapore PMETs getting retrenched”.

This statement is also wrong. There is no rising trend of local PMET retrenchments. As noted in the CA Judgment, the SDP has accepted that “local PMET” in the context of this article refers to Singapore Citizen PMETs and Permanent Resident PMETs. The number of local PMETs retrenched in 2018 was, in fact, the lowest since 2014. Local PMETs retrenched, as a proportion of all local PMET employees, has also declined since 2015.

POFMA has been used to place the facts alongside the falsehoods.


FALSEHOODS

The following are falsehoods in SDP’s Facebook posts, advertisements, and website.

Falsehood #1: The claim that Singapore Citizen PMET employment has been going down

SGP1
[Screenshot from SDP’s Facebook post]

As found in the CA Judgment, “Local PMET” in this graphic refers to “Singapore Citizen PMETs”. This graphic depicts the number of Singapore Citizen PMETs employed as having fallen sharply. This is false.

Fact #1:  the number of Singapore Citizen PMETs employed has increased from about 0.93 million in 2015 to about 1.05 million in 2019. 

The Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s Comprehensive Labour Force Survey (CLFS) shows that Singapore Citizen PMET employment has risen steadily since 2015. 


Source: Comprehensive Labour Force Survey, Manpower Research & Statistics Department, MOM

It should be noted that MOM does not usually decompose resident labour market statistics into Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. Singapore Citizens make up a large majority of the labour force, at about 85%. The Permanent Resident population has also remained stable over time at about 0.5 million. These two facts taken together means that for the most part, resident data mirrors citizen data, and having citizen data in addition to resident data provides little additional information.

Falsehood #2 - The claim that Singaporean PMET retrenchment has been going up. 

The SDP website states that the party’s “proposal comes amidst a rising proportion of Singapore PMETs getting retrenched”. This statement is false. As found in the CA Judgment, the SDP has, by its statement, asserted that local PMET retrenchment has been increasing, in numerical terms. As noted in the CA Judgment, the SDP has accepted that “local PMETs” in relation to the SDP’s website article refers to Singapore Citizen PMETs and Permanent Resident PMETs.  

Fact #2a: There has been no rising trend of local retrenchments since 2015.

Fact #2b: There has been no rising trend of local PMET retrenchment since 2015. The number of retrenched local PMETs has declined from 6,460 in 2015 to 5,360 in 2018, the lowest since 2014.

CLARIFICATION ON FOREIGN PMETS

SDP’s graph above also depicts the number of foreign PMETs as having increased sharply in recent years.

The number of Employment Pass (EP) holders has historically fluctuated depending on economic conditions.  EP qualifying salaries are also regularly adjusted to safeguard employment of local PMETs.  As a result, local PMET employment has continued to grow while the number of EP holders in Singapore remained stable, ranging from 187,900 in 2015 to 185,800 in 2018. The figure as of Jun 2019 is 189,000.

SDP’s statements seek to mislead Singaporeans

The Singapore economy is continuing to create jobs despite the economic headwinds. Singapore Citizen PMET employment has increased consistently. There is no rising trend of retrenchment, whether amongst PMETs or otherwise.

Given the current uncertain economic climate, it is understandable that some Singaporeans feel anxious about employment prospects and retrenchments. This makes it all the more critical that public debate on the important issue of jobs is based on accurate facts, and not distortions or falsehoods.

These false and misleading statements by the SDP have a singular objective – to stoke fear and anxiety among local PMETs. It is important to set the facts straight so that Singaporeans are not misled.",Primary,,No,https://www.facebook.com/322502513454/photos/p.10158356099068455/10158356099068455/,Accessible,NA,09 October 2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

8. The website also claimed that ivermectin prevents COVID-19 infection, and that it is safe and effective in treating COVID-19, even for pregnant women. MOH and Health Sciences Authority (HSA) are aware that there are members of the public trying to import or use ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Ivermectin is a prescription-only medicine registered in Singapore specifically for the treatment of parasitic worm infections. It is not an anti-viral medicine and is not approved by HSA for preventing or treating COVID-19.
9. Self-medicating with ivermectin can be dangerous to one’s health. Side-effects associated with ivermectin include vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain, neurologic adverse events (dizziness, seizures, confusion), sudden drop in blood pressure, severe skin rash potentially requiring hospitalisation, and liver injury (hepatitis). Ivermectin can also interact with other medications used, such as blood thinners.
10. HSA takes a serious view against those engaged in the illegal sale and supply of medicines, including ivermectin, and will take strong enforcement action against such persons. Anyone convicted of the illegal sale of these medicines faces a penalty fine of up to $50,000 and/or imprisonment for a period of up to two years under the Health Products Act.

Many of the materials published on the “Truth Warriors” website mislead people into thinking that COVID-19 vaccines are not effective in reducing transmission rates of COVID-19, and promote the safety and efficacy of ivermectin in preventing viral infections and treating COVID-19. These materials are from unverified and dubious sources, and individuals who heed the advice of “Truth Warriors” can endanger themselves and the people around them.
2. The Minister for Health has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction to the “Truth Warriors” website for these falsehoods. The website is required to publish the correction notice at the top of each webpage containing the falsehoods.
3. The Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of these falsehoods, and criminal investigations will be conducted.
Corrections and clarifications on falsehoods regarding COVID-19 on “Truth Warriors” website
4.
In particular, the website has published false claims stating that:
i. The most vaccinated countries have the most cases and deaths per million population and the least vaccinated countries have the fewest cases and deaths per million population; and
ii. Vaccines do not prevent the transmission of COVID-19.
5.
evidence shows categorically that vaccines reduce COVID-19 infection, as well as serious illness and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. The latest data does not support the claim that countries with the highest vaccination rates also have the highest cases/deaths per million population. While some countries with the lowest vaccination rates also have low reported COVID-19 deaths, this is likely due to poor record collection for both vaccinations and deaths.
6. While the vaccines do not completely stop viral transmission, vaccines do reduce the risk of transmission. Vaccinated persons are less likely to transmit the virus than unvaccinated persons. Furthermore, while the vaccine on its own does not kill the

virus, it is false to suggest that the effect of the vaccine on the immune system does not lead to the killing of the virus. The vaccines cause the body to produce antibodies and immune cells that act against the virus and, in effect, kill it.
7. For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article “Corrections and Clarifications regarding content about COVID-19 by “Truth Warriors” website at https://www.gov.sg/article/factually241021”.","Additional clarifications
8. The website also claimed that ivermectin prevents COVID-19 infection, and that it is safe and effective in treating COVID-19, even for pregnant women. MOH and Health Sciences Authority (HSA) are aware that there are members of the public trying to import or use ivermectin for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Ivermectin is a prescription-only medicine registered in Singapore specifically for the treatment of parasitic worm infections. It is not an anti-viral medicine and is not approved by HSA for preventing or treating COVID-19.
9. Self-medicating with ivermectin can be dangerous to one’s health. Side-effects associated with ivermectin include vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach pain, neurologic adverse events (dizziness, seizures, confusion), sudden drop in blood pressure, severe skin rash potentially requiring hospitalisation, and liver injury (hepatitis). Ivermectin can also interact with other medications used, such as blood thinners.
10. HSA takes a serious view against those engaged in the illegal sale and supply of medicines, including ivermectin, and will take strong enforcement action against such persons. Anyone convicted of the illegal sale of these medicines faces a penalty fine of up to $50,000 and/or imprisonment for a period of up to two years under the Health Products Act.
11. The website also shares user-collated and unverified data on suspected vaccine injuries in Singapore, citing the “SG Suspected Vaccine Injuries” Telegram chat as its source. We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread misinformation which may cause public alarm, and to refer to credible sources of information instead.

3. In particular, the blog post misleads people into thinking that the COVID vaccines are the most dangerous developed recently as they have caused a substantially higher rate of death and serious injury compared to all other vaccines over the last 10 years.
4. These claims are false. COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Singapore are safe. They have been assessed to be safe and effective internationally by reputable health and scientific agencies, and in Singapore by both the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V). As of 31 October 2021, the serious adverse event incidence rate reported by healthcare professionals to HSA is 0.006% of total doses administered. Thus far, no deaths have been attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines. The benefits of receiving COVID-19 vaccines continue to far outweigh the risks of vaccination.
5. The United States’ Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)1 data do not support the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have caused a substantially higher rate of serious injury and death.

7. Second, there is much higher surveillance and awareness of adverse event reporting for COVID-19 vaccines, compared with other vaccines.
8. Third, any member of the public may report adverse events and deaths to the VAERS system, regardless whether it is caused by vaccines or other factors. The reports are not required to be verified. They often lack details and sometimes contain errors. No proof is required that the adverse event or death was caused by the vaccine. And adverse events need not be serious; they include mild side effects such as rash/cold/headaches.
9. The post has been written to falsely exaggerate the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines, and to discourage people from taking them. If people believe these falsehoods, there could be serious health consequences for those who then remain unvaccinated. As stated earlier, the evidence so far is that serious adverse events have been reported in only 0.006% of total doses administered.

MINISTRY OF HEALTH 29 NOVEMBER 2021","There are false and misleading statements about COVID-19 vaccines contained in a  blog post by Cheah Kit Sun titled  ‘Do Not Participate In A Society that Rejects You’, published on Wednesday, 20 October 2021 on various online locations, which was shared by Goh Meng Seng on Facebook (20 October 2021). It is important to correct these falsehoods, especially given the on-going vaccine booster exercise.

In particular, the blog post misleads people into thinking that the COVID vaccines are the most dangerous developed recently as they have caused a substantially higher rate of death and serious injury compared to all other vaccines over the last 10 years.

Here are the facts.

Fact #1: COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Singapore are safe. The serious adverse event incidence rate reported by healthcare professionals to HSA is 0.006% of total doses administered.
 
COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in Singapore are safe. They have been assessed to be safe and effective internationally by reputable health and scientific agencies, and in Singapore by both the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V). As of 31 October 2021, the serious adverse event incidence rate reported by healthcare professionals to HSA is 0.006% of total doses administered. Thus far, no deaths have been attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines. The benefits of receiving COVID-19 vaccines continue to far outweigh the risks of vaccination.
 
Fact #2: The United States’ Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)1 data do not support the claim that COVID-19 vaccines have caused a substantially higher rate of serious injury and death.
 
First, COVID-19 vaccines have been given to a very large proportion of the US population in 2021, while the other vaccines have been given to substantially fewer individuals in any given year. Thus, it is misleading to compare the absolute number of reported adverse events and deaths for COVID-19 and non-COVID vaccines.
Second, there is much higher surveillance and awareness of adverse event reporting for COVID-19 vaccines, compared with other vaccines.

Third,  any member of the public may report adverse events and deaths to the VAERS system, regardless whether it is caused by vaccines or other factors. The reports are not required to be verified. They often lack details and sometimes contain errors. No proof is required that the adverse event or death was caused by the vaccine. And adverse events need not be serious; they include mild side effects such as rash/cold/headaches.

The post has been written to falsely exaggerate the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines, and to discourage people from taking them. If people believe these falsehoods, there could be serious health consequences for those who then remain unvaccinated.

(i) The COVID-19 and HIV viruses could combine and become another airborne virus; and
(ii) Omicron is vaccine-resistant, and vaccines are totally useless against it.

3. The Facebook post is misleading and seeks to sow public confusion about the
COVID-19 virus as well as mistrust of COVID-19 vaccines in stating that:
i. The COVID-19 and HIV viruses could combine and become another
virus which has the characteristics of the HIV and COVID-19 viruses;
ii. The COVID-19 and HIV viruses could combine in a fully vaccinated
patient to become an airborne HIV virus which is vaccine resistant;
iii. It has been scientifically established that the Omicron variant is most
probably the combination of the HIV and COVID-19 viruses, which
combination had happened before 4 June 2021; and
iv. The currently available vaccines are totally useless against the
Omicron variant.
4. These claims are false and without any scientific basis. Genetic recombination
(that is, the exchange of genetic information) of viruses is known to occur only in
genetically related viruses. The HIV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are not related, and it
is implausible in biological terms that these viruses can undergo genetic recombination.
To date, there is also no scientific evidence that such a recombination between HIV
and SARS-CoV-2 has occurred, contrary to Goh’s assertion. 
5. The claim that HIV might become transmissible by droplets in the air is also
unfounded. Viruses simply do not change drastically enough to take on vastly different
properties. HIV is transmitted via bodily fluids, e.g., blood, semen, or vaginal
secretions, and will remain to be so.
6. There is simply no scientific evidence to make the claim that the Omicron
variant is a combination of the HIV and COVID-19 viruses.
7. There is no evidence to suggest that the currently available COVID-19 vaccines
are totally useless against the Omicron variant.
8. Studies are ongoing, and there is currently insufficient data on how the Omicron
variant affects vaccine effectiveness. Most scientists believe that existing vaccines will
retain some effectiveness against the Omicron variant, but protection may be less due
to the large number of mutations in the Omicron variant.

The Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office and Leader of the House has instructed the POFMA Office to issue a Correction Direction to ‘Wake Up, Singapore’ in relation to its Facebook and Instagram posts dated 10 February 2022. It will be required to carry correction notices on its Facebook and Instagram pages, stating that the posts contain a false statement of fact.
2. Wake Up, Singapore’s posts contained a false statement that the Committee of Privileges recommended that Mr Pritam Singh and Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap be referred for criminal proceedings, even though there was no finding by the Committee that they lied. In making this false statement, the posts suggested that the Committee had recommended referring Mr Singh and Mr Faisal to the Public Prosecutor without basis. The posts published by Wake Up, Singapore misrepresent the Committee’s findings and muddy the waters as to the proper role of the Committee.
3. For the facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article “Corrections and Clarifications on falsehoods by Wake Up, Singapore regarding the recommendations of the Committee of Privileges” at https://www.gov.sg/article/factually120222.
12 February 2022","1. On 10 February 2022, Wake Up Singapore published posts on its Instagram and Facebook accounts (“the posts”) which contain a false statement of fact.

 

Falsehood

2. The posts falsely convey that the Committee of Privileges (“the Committee”) recommended that Mr Pritam Singh (“Mr Singh”) and Mr Muhamad Faisal Bin Abdul Manap (“Mr Faisal”) be referred for criminal proceedings, even though there was no finding by the Committee that they lied.

3. This is false in various respects.

4. The Committee expressly found that Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal had lied in their evidence before the Committee.

5. The Committee’s recommendation that Mr Singh be referred to the Public Prosecutor was based on this finding which it made, that Mr Singh had lied on oath (which is a possible offence of perjury).

6. The Committee did not recommend referring Mr Faisal Manap to the Public Prosecutor for lying to the Committee. The Committee recommended referring Mr Faisal for repeatedly refusing to answer relevant questions put to him by the Committee.

 

Facts

7. In the report that the Committee presented to Parliament on 10 February 2022 (Parl. 13 of 2022) regarding the complaint against Ms Raeesah Khan (“Ms Khan”) for the Untruth spoken in Parliament (“the report”), the Committee had expressly found that Mr Singh, Ms Sylvia Lim (“Ms Lim”) and Mr Faisal had lied in their testimony before the Committee:

“… in reaching our findings above, we are satisfied that Mr Singh (and to a lesser extent, Mr Faisal and Ms Lim), have been untruthful in their evidence, under oath, to this Committee. This may amount to perjury, a serious criminal offence, in respect of which, various consequences could follow. We elaborate on that below.”1

“Based on the evidence before this Committee, we are satisfied that Mr Singh had told untruths to this Committee.”2

“We are satisfied, on the evidence, that Mr Singh lied on affirmation…”3

“Based on the evidence available to us, we are likewise satisfied that Ms Lim and Mr Faisal have lied about the 8 Aug meeting.”4

“They [Ms Lim and Mr Faisal] did not tell the truth to this Committee about that meeting.”5

 

8. The Committee found that Mr Singh (and to a lesser extent, Mr Faisal and Ms Lim) were untruthful in their evidence, under oath, to the Committee.

9. The Committee found that Mr Singh lied to the Committee on the key points, as to what had happened, and tried to conceal his involvement in Ms Khan’s Untruth.

10. The Committee found that Mr Singh lied in order to put the entire blame on Ms Khan – when, in fact, she had, from 8 August 2021, followed his advice and guidance. He said two other witnesses, Ms Loh Pei Ying (“Ms Loh”) and Mr Yudhishthra Nathan (“Mr Nathan”) (Workers’ Party cadre members), lied. He said this, in an attempt to save himself, and avoid responsibility for his own conduct. The Committee found that Ms Loh and Mr Nathan were honest and credible witnesses, who spoke the truth.   

11. The Committee found that contrary to his evidence, Mr Singh was the operating brain, the primary cause for: (1) why Ms Khan did not clarify the Untruth immediately after 8 August 2021, and (2) why Ms Khan repeated the Untruth in Parliament on 4 October 2021. This was consequent on its findings that:

On 8 August 2021, when Ms Khan confessed the Untruth to Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal, Mr Singh told Ms Khan to “take it to the grave”, i.e. take the Untruth to the grave. (The Committee also found that Ms Lim and Mr Faisal lied to the Committee about the 8 August 2021 meeting.)
 

On 3 October 2021, Mr Singh guided Ms Khan to maintain the Untruth in Parliament, if the matter came up the next day. He told Ms Khan that if she were to retain or continue with the narrative (the Untruth), “there would be no judgment” on her.
 

After Ms Khan confessed in Parliament, and when there was adverse public reaction, Mr Singh, as the Secretary-General of Workers’ Party (and Ms Lim and Mr Faisal) engineered a Disciplinary Panel (comprised only of themselves). He advised Ms Khan to lie, then held the Disciplinary Inquiry to ostensibly find out why she had lied. The Disciplinary Inquiry suppressed the fact that Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal had known and been involved in Ms Khan’s Untruth, for 3 months, and covered up Mr Singh’s role, in guiding Ms Khan to continue with the Untruth on 4 October 2021.  
12. Parliament has the power to impose penalties on Mr Singh, based on the Committee’s findings that he lied on oath (which is an offence under the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act 1962).
 
13. The Committee however has recommended referring Mr Singh’s conduct to the Public Prosecutor, so that Mr Singh will have the opportunity to defend and vindicate himself, with legal counsel, if criminal charges are brought, and so that a court can look at the matter afresh, and consider any further evidence that may emerge, and decide whether any charge(s) have been proved, or not proved, beyond reasonable doubt.
 
14. The Committee also found that Mr Faisal deliberately refused to answer a question put by the Committee. He refused eight times, even though he was told that such refusal to answer may be an offence. He has been referred to the Public Prosecutor for his conduct, in refusing to answer.

14. The Committee also found that Mr Faisal deliberately refused to answer a question put by the Committee. He refused eight times, even though he was told that such refusal to answer may be an offence. He has been referred to the Public Prosecutor for his conduct, in refusing to answer.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) is aware that “Wake Up, Singapore” (WUSG) had posted allegations across its website, Facebook, and Instagram pages on 23 March 2022, which claimed that a COVID-positive patient who was 20 weeks pregnant had suffered a miscarriage after waiting four hours to see a doctor at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) A&E department in February 2022. These allegations are false.
2. KKH had identified the patient in question based on a screenshot of a hospital bill accompanying WUSG’s posts, which contained discrepancies with the patient’s account of events. Subsequent investigations by KKH have confirmed that the patient had been seen by a doctor within an hour of her arrival at KKH in February 2022, and did not suffer any miscarriage.
3. On 25 March 2022, WUSG published further posts on its Facebook and Instagram pages, stating that they have been informed by the patient that her recollection was false, and that WUSG “may have been fed lies at every turn”. WUSG has also apologised to KKH for publishing these allegations.
4. Notwithstanding WUSG’s apology, the allegations are serious and have been circulated to various other platforms. This could lead to the erosion of public trust in the credibility and professionalism of our healthcare system and institutions. Accordingly, the Minister for Health has instructed the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) Office to issue a Correction Direction to “Wake Up, Singapore” in respect of the falsehoods, to ensure that the public is provided with the full facts. “Wake Up, Singapore” is required to publish the correction notices as specified by the POFMA Office for each webpage and social media post containing the falsehoods.
5. The Government takes a serious view of these falsehoods, which appear to have been fabricated. The matter has been referred to the relevant authorities for investigation. KKH had also lodged a Police Report on 25 March 2022.
6. For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article “Corrections regarding patient who allegedly suffered miscarriage after four-hour wait at KKH at https://www.gov.sg/article/factually260322”.
7. We urge the public not to spread unsubstantiated information, which may cause public alarm.
